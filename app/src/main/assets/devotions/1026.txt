<h1>Bread of Life</h1>

<aside>I am the living bread that came down from heaven . . . <br />&mdash;John 6:51</aside><p>In John 6:48 we read that Jesus said, &#8220;I am the bread of life.&#8221; Jesus had just fed 5,000 people with five loaves and two fishes. They were all excited and thrilled over the great miracle that had occurred, [but] Jesus was talking about something more important than social needs. Bread in the Scriptures is a symbol of spiritual life.</p>
<p>Man has an inborn hunger for God. He cannot be satisfied with anything less than God. God alone can supply the bread which satisfies the inner longing of your soul and the hunger of your heart. . . . The Bible says that He is the Bread of Life.</p>
