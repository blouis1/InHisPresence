<h1>Meditate on Scripture</h1>

<aside>How can a young man stay pure? By reading your Word and following its rules.<br />&mdash;Psalm 119:9 (TLB)</aside><p>Many of the difficulties we experience as Christians can be traced to a lack of Bible study and reading. We should not be content to skim through a chapter merely to satisfy our conscience. Hide the Word of God in your heart! A little portion well digested is of greater value to the soul than a lengthy portion scanned hurriedly. Do not be discouraged because you cannot understand it all. Go on reading. As you read, the Holy Spirit will enlighten the passages for you. Reading the Bible has a purifying effect upon the heart and mind.</p>
