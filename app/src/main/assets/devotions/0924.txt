<h1>A Living Presence</h1>

<aside>A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.<br />&mdash;Luke 2:32</aside><p>If we could look through mighty telescopes or listen to electronic soundings, we could hear and see the metallic stars which both Russia and America have put into space in the past years. None of these synthetic stars have brought peace to the world. But God&#8217;s star promised peace to the whole world, if man would believe and trust.</p>
<p>Too often man&#8217;s synthetic stars bring fear and anxiety. Our gadget-filled paradise, suspended in a hell of international insecurity, certainly does not offer us the happiness of which the last century dreamed.</p>
<p>But there is still a star in the sky. There is still a song in the air. And Jesus Christ is alive. He is with us, a living presence, to conquer despair, to impart hope, to forgive sins, and to take away our loneliness and reconcile us to God.</p>
