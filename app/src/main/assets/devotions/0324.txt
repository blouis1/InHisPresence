<h1>God’s Endless Love</h1>

<aside>But to all who received him, he gave the right to become children of God.<br />&mdash;John 1:12 (TLB)</aside><p>Who can describe or measure the love of God? God is love. But the fact that God is love does not mean that everything is sweet, beautiful, and happy, and that God&#8217;s love could not possibly allow punishment for sin. God&#8217;s holiness demands that all sin be punished, but God&#8217;s love provided a plan of redemption and salvation for sinful man. God&#8217;s love provided the cross of Jesus Christ by which man can have forgiveness and cleansing. It was the love of God that sent Jesus Christ to the cross.</p>
<p>No matter what sin you have committed, no matter how black, dirty, shameful, or terrible it may be, God loves you. Yet this love of God that is immeasurable, unmistakable, and unending, this love of God that reaches to wherever a man is, can be entirely rejected. God will not force Himself upon anyone against his will. It is your part to believe. It is your part to receive. Nobody else can do it for you.</p>
