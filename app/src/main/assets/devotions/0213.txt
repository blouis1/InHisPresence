<h1>Chosen by God</h1>

<aside>. . . you have been chosen by God who has given you this new kind of life . . .<br />&mdash;Colossians 3:12 (TLB)</aside><p>Modern writers depict the pessimism of our time and many of them throw up their hands in despair and say, &#8220;There is no answer to man&#8217;s dilemma.&#8221; Hemingway once said, &#8220;I live in a vacuum that is as lonely as a radio tube when the batteries are dead, and there is no current to plug into.&#8221; Eugene O&#8217;Neill in &#8220;Long Day&#8217;s Journey Into Night&#8221; typifies the philosophical attitude of our day. He says, &#8220;Life&#8217;s only meaning is death.&#8221; I say to Hemingway and to O&#8217;Neill, who have already gone on, &#8220;There is more to life than death.&#8221; There is more to life than a radio tube that needs a place to plug into. Jesus taught us the dignity and importance of being a person. God put us on this earth for a purpose, and our purpose is fellowship with God and to glorify God.</p>
