<h1>God is Love!</h1>

<aside>Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love . . . <br />&mdash;Jeremiah 31:3</aside><p>As I read the Bible, I find love to be the supreme and dominant attribute of God. The promises of God&#8217;s love and forgiveness are as real, as sure, as positive, as human words can make them. But the total beauty of the ocean cannot be understood until it is seen, and it is the same with God&#8217;s love. Until you actually experience it, until you actually possess it, no one can describe its wonders to you. </p>
<p>Never question God&#8217;s great love, for it is as unchangeable a part of God as His holiness. Were it not for the love of God, none of us would ever have a chance in the future life. But God is love! And His love for us is everlasting.</p>
