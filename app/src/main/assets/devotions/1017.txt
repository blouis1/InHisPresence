<h1>Searching for Peace?</h1>

<aside>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee ...<br />&mdash;Isaiah 26:3</aside><p>Are you searching for peace? Are you longing for it? You thought you would find it if you made a lot of money, but you didn&#8217;t find it. You thought you would find it in getting and accumulating a lot of knowledge, so you got all the degrees you could, but you didn&#8217;t find it, this peace.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve searched the religions of the world, but you haven&#8217;t found it. There are a thousand ways you&#8217;ve turned, trying to find peace, but you haven&#8217;t found it. When you come to Christ by an act of faith, He gives you the Holy Spirit who produces the fruit of the Spirit and gives you the peace that passes all understanding.</p>
