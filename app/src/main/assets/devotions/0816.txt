<h1>Hunger for Righteousness</h1>

<aside>I will give to the thirsty the springs of the Water of Life—as a gift!<br />&mdash;Revelation 21:6 (TLB)</aside><p>God says that only those who hunger after righteousness will receive it. God thrusts this heavenly manna on no one. You must desire it, above everything else. Your yearning for God must supersede all other desires. It must be like a gnawing hunger and a burning thirst.</p>
