<h1>Jesus Never Changes</h1>

<aside>Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and for ever.<br />&mdash;Hebrews 13:8</aside><p>The Bible says, &#8220;It is appointed unto men once to die,&#8221; and to the average person this seems a stark and hopeless situation. Hundreds of philosophies and scores of religions have been invented to circumvent the Word of God. Modern philosophers and psychologists are still trying to make it appear that there is some way out other than the path of Jesus. But people have tried them all, and none of them leads anywhere but down. Christ came to give us the answers to the three enduring problems of sin, sorrow, and death. It is Jesus Christ, and He alone, who is also enduring and unchanging, &#8220;the same yesterday, today, and forever.&#8221; All other things may change, but Christ remains unchangeable.</p>
<p>In the restless sea of human passions Christ stands steadfast and calm, ready to welcome all who will turn to Him and accept the blessings of safety and peace. For we are living in an age of grace, in which God promises that &#8220;whosoever will&#8221; may come and receive His Son. But this period of grace will not go on indefinitely. We are even now living on borrowed time.</p>
