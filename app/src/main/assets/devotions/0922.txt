<h1>Salvation is An Act of God</h1>

<aside>There is salvation in no one else! Under all heaven there is no other name for men to call upon to save them.<br />&mdash;Acts 4:12 (TLB)</aside><p>Salvation is an act of God. It is initiated by God, wrought by God, and sustained by God. The faith that saves the soul is described as faith in Christ as the Son of God-not as a good man or a great man, but as the uniquely begotten Son of the living God!</p>
<p>This is consistent with the witness of the entire New Testament and with the proclamations of the first preachers of the Gospel. All proclaim the necessity of faith in Jesus Christ as deity.</p>
