<h1>Be Sensitive</h1>

<aside>If a person isn't loving and kind, it shows that he doesn't know God—for God is love.<br />&mdash;1 John 4:8 (TLB)</aside><p>Jesus wept tears of compassion at the graveside of a friend. He mourned over Jerusalem because as a city it had lost its appreciation of the things of the Spirit. His great heart was sensitive to the needs of others. To emphasize the importance of man&#8217;s love for men, He revised an old commandment to make it read, &#8220;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart . . . and thy neighbor as thyself.&#8221; This generation is rough and tough. I heard a little boy boasting one day about how tough he was. He said, &#8220;On the street I live on, the farther out you go the tougher they get, and I live in the last house.&#8221; Until you have learned the value of compassionately sharing others&#8217; sorrow, distress, and misfortune, you cannot know real happiness.</p>
