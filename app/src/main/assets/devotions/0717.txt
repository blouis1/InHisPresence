<h1>Jesus to the Rescue</h1>

<aside>God is our refuge and strength, a tested help in times of trouble.<br />&mdash;Psalm 46:1 (TLB)</aside><p>Scripture tells us that God tempts no one. Temptation always comes from the devil. God will test us and allow us to endure the temptation, but the devil does the tempting. How do we overcome it? A little girl once told her method. &#8220;When the devil comes knocking at the door,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t answer it. I send Jesus to the door.&#8221; And that is exactly the way to take care of it. Send Jesus to the door!</p>
