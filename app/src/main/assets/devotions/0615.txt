<h1>Practice Good Stewardship</h1>

<aside>Redeeming the time . . . <br />&mdash;Ephesians 5:16</aside><p>We are stewards of our time. God has given each one of us a little &#8220;chunk of eternity&#8221; called time. These golden moments of opportunity are doled out to us for our benefit and for God&#8217;s glory. If we use them wisely, they are woven by God&#8217;s omnipotent hand into the fabric of eternity. Henry Thoreau cautioned, &#8220;You cannot kill time without injuring eternity.&#8221; &#8220;He who has no vision of eternity,&#8221; said Carlyle, &#8220;has no hold on time.&#8221; &#8220;Only one life, &#8217;twill soon be past; only what&#8217;s done for Christ will last&#8221; is the sentiment of every man who desires to be a good steward of his time. We are entrusted with a small portion of the capital of time. If we invest it wisely, it will pay dividends throughout eternity.</p>
