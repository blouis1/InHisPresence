<h1>His Indwelling Presence</h1>

<aside>. . . to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God.<br />&mdash;Ephesians 3:19</aside><p>To appreciate art, one must either be born with an artistic sense or develop it by training. Only a relatively few people have an innate sense of color, form, and harmony. To such, a love for art comes naturally. Without an artistic appreciation in one&#8217;s soul, visiting an art gallery can be a boring affair. Likewise, to appreciate good music one must have music &#8220;in him&#8221; or develop it. Without a sense of music appreciation, it is possible to sleep through a symphony concert or a performance of the Metropolitan Opera. So it is with the things of God.</p>
<p>Talk about God can become dreary and lackluster if God isn&#8217;t in you. Church can become a drab thing and the Bible an irksome Book if the Holy Spirit does not illuminate your soul with His indwelling presence. The wonderful thing about it all is that God has planned life so that if our hearts are dead to spiritual things, something can be done about it.</p>
