<h1>The Sufficiency of God</h1>

<aside>I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.

<br />&mdash;John 10:10</aside><p>In God&#8217;s economy, you must go down into the valley of grief before you can scale the heights of spiritual glory. You must become tired and weary of living alone before you seek and find the fellowship of Christ. You must come to the end of &#8220;self&#8221; before you can begin to live. The happiest day of my life was when I realized that my own ability, my own goodness, and my own morality were insufficient in the sight of God. I am not exaggerating when I say that my mourning was turned to joy, and my sighing into singing. Happy are they that mourn for the inadequacy of self, for they shall be comforted with the sufficiency of God.</p>
