<aside>Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.<br />&mdash;2 Corinthians 9:15</aside><p>A gift is not a gift unless it is accepted. God has given you His Son, but ownership is conditional on acceptance. God does not force His gift on us, but He asks us to receive by faith the gift of His Son, Jesus Christ. A person who deliberately refuses God&#8217;s offer of love, mercy, and forgiveness is lost. Most people gratefully receive a gift when given in love. The greatest sin that a person can commit is to refuse God&#8217;s love.</p>
