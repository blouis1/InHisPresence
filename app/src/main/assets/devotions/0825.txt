<h1>The Purity of Marriage</h1>

<aside>Whatsoever things are pure . . . think on these things.<br />&mdash;Philippians 4:8</aside><p>Nowhere does the Bible teach that sex in itself is a sin. Man in his sinful nature has taken what was intended to be a glorious and complete act of love between two people and has made it something low, cheap, and dirty. The Bible is one of the world&#8217;s outspoken books on the subject of sex, and the Bible condemns sex outside the bonds of matrimony. The fact that immorality is rampant throughout the nation doesn&#8217;t make it right; the fact that some clergymen may condone it doesn&#8217;t make it right. The Bible says, &#8220;There is a way that seemeth right unto a man; but the end thereof are the ways of death&#8221; (Proverbs 16:25). Under Jewish law adultery was punishable by death. Under God&#8217;s law today it also results in spiritual death.</p>
