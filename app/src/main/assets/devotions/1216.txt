<h1>Why the Righteous Suffer</h1>

<aside>God will tenderly comfort you when you undergo these same sufferings . . . <br />&mdash;2 Corinthians 1:7 (TLB)</aside><p>This question, &#8220;Why must the righteous suffer?&#8221; is as old as time. There is only one place that we can find an answer, and that is in the Bible. You do not need to study the Scriptures long to learn why sinners meet reverses and anguish. They are apart from God. Their sorrow is the result of their sins. But-why do Christians suffer?</p>
<p>Scripture teaches that many Christians suffer so that they may fellowship with others who are in affliction. Only those who have known sorrow and suffering can have fellowship with those in affliction. The Word of God also teaches that Christians suffer in order that they might glorify God in their lives. The Bible further teaches that Christians suffer in order that God might teach them lessons in prayer. Also, Christians suffer in order that God might bring them to repentance.</p>
