<h1>The Responsibility of Discipleship</h1>

<aside>Even while we were still there with you we gave you this rule: &#39;He who does not work shall not eat.'<br />&mdash;2 Thessalonians 3:10 (TLB)</aside><p>One of the Christian&#8217;s responsibilities in following Christ is to have a new attitude toward work. So many young people want Christ without responsibility. Jesus was not a drop-out. As a carpenter, He worked hard with His hands. The Apostle Paul made tents for a living while he carried on the work that God assigned him. Whatever work a Christian does is done unto the Lord. He should do his best at whatever his trade or vocation. He should be faithful, clean, and honest.</p>
