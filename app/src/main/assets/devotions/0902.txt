<h1>The Struggles of Life</h1>

<aside>Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree ...

<br />&mdash;1 Peter 2:24</aside><p>All life is a struggle—that is the nature of things. Even within our physical bodies, doctors tell us, a conflict for supremacy is going on. The bacteria in our bloodstream are waging a constant war against alien germs. The red corpuscles fight the white corpuscles constantly in an effort to maintain life within the body. A battle is also raging in the spiritual realm. &#8220;We fight,&#8221; the Bible says, &#8220;against the rulers of the darkness of this world.&#8221; Darkness hates light. I have a dog that would rather dig up a moldy carcass to chew on than to have the finest, cleanest meal. He can&#8217;t help it—that is his nature. Men cannot help that it is their nature to respond to the lewd, the salacious, and the vile. They will have difficulty doing otherwise until they are born again. And until they are changed by the power of Christ, they will likely be at enmity against those who are associated with Christ.</p>
