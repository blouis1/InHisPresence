<h1>Who is He?</h1>

<aside>. . . for they have rejected the word of the Lord . . . <br />&mdash;Jeremiah 8:9 (TLB)</aside><p>The Apostle Paul once asked, &#8220;Who art thou, Lord?&#8221; That is a question each of us has to face. If Jesus claimed to be the Son of God, knowing He was not, then He was a deceiver, the greatest liar the world has ever known. If He thought He was God and didn&#8217;t know the difference, then He was a mental case. But if He was who He claimed to be, then He is rightfully the Lord of our lives. What keeps us from acknowledging this Christ, if He is what the Bible tells us He is?</p>
<p>Each of us has to face the question that Pilate asked, &#8220;What shall I do then with Jesus which is called the Christ?&#8221; Pilate washed his hands and said he would have nothing to do with Jesus, but God does not let us off that way. We must say &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no.&#8221; We can make fun of Jesus, we can reject Him, we can neglect Him—or we can receive Him.</p>
