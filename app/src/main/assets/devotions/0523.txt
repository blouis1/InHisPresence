<h1>An Answer to Problems</h1>

<aside>. . . Thou shalt love the Lord thy God. . . . Thou shalt love thy neighbor . . . <br />&mdash;Matthew 22:37–39</aside><p>Here is the answer to the world&#8217;s problems today—&#8221;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,&#8221; &#8220;Thou shalt love thy fellowman.&#8221; That teaching is not out-of-date; it is absolutely relevant today. It is the only way in which the problems of the world today can be solved, whether the problems are those of individuals or of nations. If we love God with all our heart, we will have a capacity to love our neighbors. True love will find an outlet in service—not merely in singing hymns, attending church, or even in praying—but in trying our utmost to prove our love, by obeying the will of our heavenly Father.</p>
