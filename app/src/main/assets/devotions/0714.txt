<h1>An Upside Down World</h1>

<aside>Follow not that which is evil, but that which is good . . . <br />&mdash;3 John 11</aside><p>We must get this fact firmly fixed in our minds: we live in an upside-down world. People hate when they should love, quarrel when they should be friendly, fight when they should be peaceful, wound when they should heal, steal when they should share, do wrong when they should do right. I once saw a toy clown with a weight in its head. No matter what position you put it in, it invariably assumed an upside-down position. Put it on its feet or on its side, and when you let go it flipped back on its head. Unregenerate people are just like that! Do what you may with them and they always revert to an upside-down position. That is why the disciples to the world were misfits. To an upside-down person, a right-side up person seems upside down. To a sinner, a righteous person is an oddity and an abnormality. A Christian&#8217;s goodness is a rebuke to the wicked; his being right-side up is a reflection upon the worldling&#8217;s inverted position.</p>
