<h1>Our Greatest Need</h1>

<aside>I stretch forth my hands unto thee; my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land...<br />&mdash;Psalm 143:6</aside><p>Not long ago I visited the dean of a great American university. We looked out the window of his office and watched hundreds of students walking to their classes. I asked the dean, &#8220;What is the greatest problem at this university?&#8221; He thought a moment and answered, &#8220;Emptiness.&#8221; So many people today are bored, lonely, searching for something. You can see it in their faces.</p>
<p>One girl home from college told her wealthy father, &#8220;Father, I want something but I don&#8217;t know what it is.&#8221; That&#8217;s true of many people; we want something to meet the deepest problems of our lives, but we haven&#8217;t found it. David said, &#8220;I have found it. I shall not want.&#8221; The Apostle Paul expressed it, &#8220;I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content.&#8221;</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to give up on life, to throw up your hands and cry, &#8220;It&#8217;s no use.&#8221; . . . You can have God&#8217;s peace, God&#8217;s joy, God&#8217;s happiness, God&#8217;s security; and yours can become the most thrilling life in the world.</p>
