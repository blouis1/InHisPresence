<h1>Count Your Blessings</h1>

<aside>. . . when troubles come . . . sing his praises with much joy.<br />&mdash;Psalm 27:5,6 (TLB)</aside><p>Christians are not altogether immune from depression. The fact is: the trend of events and the mounting tide of evil are enough to give one sobering thoughts—Christian or not. David, the sweet singer of Israel, was not always on top of his depression. Sometimes his glad song was turned to a depressive mourning. &#8220;My tears have been my meat day and night, while continually they say unto me, Where is thy God? Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why art thou disquieted in me?&#8221; I find that the cure for depression is praise. In other words: be so busy counting your blessings, that thoughts of gloom and despair will be crowded out.</p>
