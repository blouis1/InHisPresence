<h1>Who Am I?</h1>

<aside>What a glorious Lord! He who daily bears our burdens also gives us our salvation.<br />&mdash;Psalm 68:19 (TLB)</aside><p>Edward Dahlberg, the writer, observed, &#8220;At 19, I was a stranger to myself. At 40, I asked, &#8216;Who am I?&#8217; At 50, I concluded I would never know.&#8221; This unexplored personal wilderness is the home of millions of people. Ninety-two percent of all Canadian university students, according to June Callwood, the Toronto sociologist, don&#8217;t really know who they are. The Bible says that man is an immortal soul. When God made man in the first place, He created him and &#8220;breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul&#8221; (Genesis 2:7). One&#8217;s soul is the essence, the core, the eternal and real person. And he will be restless until he opens his life to Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord.</p>
