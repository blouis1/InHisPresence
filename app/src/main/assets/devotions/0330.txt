<h1>Endless Forgiveness</h1>

<aside>For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us . . . <br />&mdash;1 Thessalonians 5:9,10</aside><p>Look at Christ&#8217;s death. In one biography of the great American, Daniel Webster, 863 pages deal with his career and just five pages are devoted to his death. In Hay&#8217;s life of Abraham Lincoln there are 5,000 pages but only 25 are devoted to the dramatic story of his assassination and death. In most biographies the deaths of the subjects are mere incidents at the close of the books. But when we come to the four &#8220;biographies&#8221; of Jesus, the four Gospels, we are confronted with a strange fact. One-third of Matthew is given to a description of the death of Christ. One-third of Mark, one-fourth of Luke, and one-half of John are given to His death. All these pages are devoted to the last 24 hours of His life. The death of Jesus Christ is a significant fact in human history, because Jesus Christ came for the express purpose of dying for sinners. When He left heaven, He knew He was going to the cross.</p>
