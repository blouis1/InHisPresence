<h1>The Mystery of Heaven</h1>

<aside>I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.<br />&mdash;Psalm 23:6</aside><p>What will heaven be like? Just as there is a mystery to hell, so there is a mystery to heaven. Yet I believe the Bible teaches that heaven is a literal place. Is it one of the stars? I don&#8217;t know, I can&#8217;t even speculate. The Bible doesn&#8217;t inform us. I believe that out there in space where there are one thousand million galaxies, each a hundred thousand light years or more in diameter, God can find some place to put us in heaven. I&#8217;m not worried about where it is. I know it will be where Jesus is. Christians don&#8217;t have to go around discouraged and despondent, with their shoulders bent. Think of it-the joy, the peace, the sense of forgiveness that He gives you, and then heaven, too.</p>
