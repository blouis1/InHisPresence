<h1>What is Conscience?</h1>

<aside>Having a good conscience . . . <br />&mdash;1 Peter 3:16</aside><p>What is conscience? God has put within each one of us something that cries aloud against us, whenever we do that which we know to be wrong. Conscience is the detective that watches the direction of our steps and decries every conscious transgression. Conscience is a vigilant eye before which each imagination, thought, and act, is held up for either censure or approval.</p>
<p>I believe there is no greater argument for the existence of God in the world today than conscience. There is no greater proof of the existence of a moral law and Lawgiver in the universe than this little light of the soul. It is God&#8217;s voice to the inner man. Conscience is our wisest counselor and teacher, our most faithful and most patient friend.</p>
