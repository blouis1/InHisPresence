<h1>A Covenant With Eyes</h1>

<aside>Keep thyself pure.<br />&mdash;1 Timothy 5:22</aside><p>Someone has said, &#8220;You cannot help the first look, but the second is sin.&#8221; Jesus indicated that you can engage in immorality by a look. The Bible places the &#8220;lust of the eye&#8221; right along with other major sins. Listen: &#8220;For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.&#8221; Peter spoke of having &#8220;eyes full of adultery.&#8221; No wonder Job said, &#8220;I have made a covenant with my eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?&#8221; Your eyes see only what your soul allows them to see.</p>
