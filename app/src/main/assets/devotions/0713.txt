<h1>The Power of Choice</h1>

<aside>The Lord hath anointed me . . . to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.<br />&mdash;Isaiah 61:1</aside><p>Viktor Frankl in his book, &#8220;Man&#8217;s Search for Meaning,&#8221; describes the reactions of two brothers with the same heredity, the same environment, in the same concentration camp under the Nazis. One became a saint and the other a swine. Frankl tells us the reason why. He said, &#8220;Each man has within him the power to choose how he will react to any given situation.&#8221; God has given us the power of choice. Some people today do not wish to accept the responsibility for their actions. They blame society. They blame the environment. They blame the schools. They blame the circumstances. But Adam sinned in a perfect environment under perfect circumstances. We can&#8217;t blame it all on somebody else. We must accept the blame ourselves for our part. Society is made up of individuals. If we have social injustice, we&#8217;re the ones who are wrong; we&#8217;re part of it. Let&#8217;s accept our responsibility to do something about it.</p>
