<h1>Jesus is Matchless</h1>

<aside>You have your life through Christ Jesus. He showed us God's plan of salvation; he was the one who made us acceptable to God . . . <br />&mdash;1 Corinthians 1:30 (TLB)</aside><p>More and more I am becoming aware of the truth that people change people as much as ideas change people. The power of personality is strong. One could find many illustrations to prove that often personality is greater than the idea. Such is the case with Christianity. The secret of the power of Christianity is not in its ethics. It is not in Christian ideas or philosophy, although Christianity has a philosophical set of ideas. The secret of Christianity is found in a Person, and that Person is the Lord Jesus Christ. Men have discovered other philosophical and ethical systems, but they have not found another Jesus Christ. No one in history can match Him.</p>
