<h1>Word Made Flesh</h1>

<aside>The Word was made flesh . . . full of grace and truth.<br />&mdash;John 1:14</aside><p>On the cover of your Bible and my Bible appear the words &#8220;Holy Bible.&#8221; Do you know why the Bible is called holy? Why should it be called holy when so much lust and hate and greed and war are found in it? It is because the Bible tells the truth. It tells the truth about God, about man, and about the devil. The Bible teaches that we exchange the truth of God for the devil&#8217;s lie about sex, for example; and drugs, and alcohol, and religious hypocrisy. Jesus Christ is the ultimate truth. Furthermore, He told the truth. Jesus said that He was the truth, and the truth would make us free.</p>
