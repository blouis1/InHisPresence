<h1>Not Just a Man</h1>

<aside>And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.<br />&mdash;Colossians 1:17</aside><p>Napoleon was right when he said, &#8220;I know men, and I tell you, Jesus is more than a man. Comparison is impossible between Him and any other human being who ever lived, because He was the Son of God.&#8221; Emerson was right when he replied to those who asked him why he did not include Jesus among his Representative Men, &#8220;Jesus was not just a man.&#8221; Arnold Toynbee was right when he said, &#8220;As we stand and gaze with our eyes fixed upon the farther shore, a simple figure rises from the flood and straightway fills the whole horizon of history. There is the Savior.&#8221;</p>
