<h1>Cleansed by the Blood</h1>

<aside>. . . unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood.<br />&mdash;Revelation 1:5</aside><p>Blood is mentioned 460 times in the Bible. Fourteen times in the New Testament Jesus spoke of His own blood. Why? Because by the shedding of His blood, He accomplished the possibility of our salvation. He paid the penalty for our sin and redeemed us. The penalty for our sin and rebellion is death; Jesus stepped out and said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take that death.&#8221; He voluntarily laid down His life and took the penalty we deserve. That&#8217;s what the cross is all about.</p>
<p>The blood of Jesus Christ not only redeems us, it justifies us. Being justified means more than being forgiven. I can say, &#8220;I forgive you,&#8221; but I can&#8217;t justify you. But God not only forgives the past, He clothes you in righteousness as though you had never committed a sin. Yet it cost the blood of His Son on the cross.</p>
