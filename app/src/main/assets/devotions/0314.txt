<h1>Happiness</h1>

<aside>So don't be anxious about tomorrow. God will take care of your tomorrow too. Live one day at a time.<br />&mdash;Matthew 6:34 (TLB)</aside><p>King George V wrote on the flyleaf of the Bible of a friend, &#8220;The secret of happiness is not to do what you like to do, but to learn to like what you have to do.&#8221; Too many think of happiness as some sort of will-o&#8217;-the-wisp thing that is discovered by constant and relentless searching. It is not found by seeking. It is not an end in itself. Pots of gold are never found at the end of the rainbow, as we used to think when we were children; gold is mined from the ground or panned laboriously from a mountain stream.</p>
<p>Jesus once told His disciples, &#8220;Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.&#8221; The &#8220;things&#8221; He spoke of were the things that make us feel happy and secure—food, drink, clothes, shelter. He told us not to make these the chief goal of our lives but to &#8220;seek the kingdom&#8221; and these needs would be automatically supplied. There, if we will take it, is the secret of happiness.</p>
