<h1>Christmas is Not a Myth</h1>

<aside>When the fullness of the time was come, <BR>God sent forth . . . his Son . . .<br />&mdash;Galatians 4:4</aside><p>Christmas is not a myth, not a tradition, not a dream. It is a glorious reality. It is a time of joy. Bethlehem&#8217;s manger crib became the link that bound a lost world to a loving God. From that manger came a Man who not only taught us a new way of life, but brought us into a new relationship with our Creator. Christmas means that God is interested in the affairs of people, that God loves us so much that He was willing to give His Son.</p>
