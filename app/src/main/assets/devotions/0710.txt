<h1>Time For Us</h1>

<aside>Do not worry about your life . . . <br />&mdash;Matthew 6:25 (NIV)</aside><p>Some people ask, &#8220;Do you think God has time for me? You don&#8217;t know how mixed up my life is, how confused it is; the pressures, the tension at home, the business problems, so many things I couldn&#8217;t possibly tell you about, including the sins in my life that I somehow cannot seem to give up.&#8221; Yes, God has time for you. When Jesus was dying on the cross, He had time for a thief who turned to Him and said, &#8220;Lord, remember me.&#8221; That&#8217;s all the record tells us that the thief said, &#8220;Lord, remember me.&#8221; But what he was really saying was, &#8220;I&#8217;m unworthy. I&#8217;ve broken all the laws. I deserve hell. Just remember me.&#8221; And Jesus turned to him in that moment and said, &#8220;Today you will be with me in Paradise.&#8221;</p>
