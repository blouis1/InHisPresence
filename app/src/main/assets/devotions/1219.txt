<h1>A God of Justice</h1>

<aside>What joy there is for anyone whose sins are no longer counted against him by the Lord.<br />&mdash;Romans 4:8 (TLB)</aside><p>A number of years ago I was stopped for driving too fast in a speed zone, and in the courtroom I pleaded guilty. The judge was not only friendly but embarrassed for me to be in his court. The fine was ten dollars. If he had let me go free, it would have been inconsistent with justice. The penalty had to be paid either by me or someone else! Judgment is consistent with love. A God of love must be a God of justice. It is because God loves that He is just. His justice balances His love and makes His acts of both love and justice meaningful.</p>
<p>God could not consistently love men, if He did not provide for the judgment of evil-doers. His punishment of the evil-doer and His separation of the righteous is a manifestation of God&#8217;s great love. We must always look at the cross on the dark background of judgment. It was because God&#8217;s love for man was so intense that He gave His Son, so that man would not have to face judgment.</p>
