<h1>Prayer is a Conversation</h1>

<aside>And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.<br />&mdash;Matthew 21:22</aside><p>Prayer is a two-way conversation; it is our talking to God, and His talking to us. As a Christian, you have a heavenly Father who hears and answers prayer. Jesus said, &#8220;All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.&#8221; Every man or woman whose life has counted for the church and the Kingdom of God has been a person of prayer. You cannot afford to be too busy to pray. A prayerless Christian is a powerless Christian. Jesus Christ spent many hours in prayer. Sometimes He spent the night on a mountaintop in solitary communion with God the Father. If He felt that He had to pray, how much more do we need to pray!</p>
