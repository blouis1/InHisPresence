<h1>Seek God For Yourself</h1>

<aside>Know ye that the Lord he is God; it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves . . . <br />&mdash;Psalm 100:3</aside><p>Whenever anyone asks me how I can be so certain about who and what God really is, I am reminded of the story of the little boy who was out flying a kite. It was a fine day to go kite-flying, the wind was brisk, and large billowy clouds were blowing across the sky. The kite went up and up until it was entirely hidden by the clouds. &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; a man asked the little boy. &#8220;I&#8217;m flying a kite,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Flying a kite, are you?&#8221; the man said, &#8220;How can you be sure? You can&#8217;t see your kite.&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; said the little boy, &#8220;I can&#8217;t see it, but every little while I feel a tug, so I know for sure that it&#8217;s there!&#8221; Don&#8217;t take anyone else&#8217;s word for God. Find Him for yourself, and then you too will know by the wonderful, warm tug on your heartstring, that He is there, for sure.</p>
