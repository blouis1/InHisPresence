<h1>Rejoice in Him</h1>

<aside>I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.<br />&mdash;Habakkuk 3:18</aside><p>Christians are supposed to be happy persons! Our generation has become well versed in Christian terminology, but is remiss in the actual practice of Christ&#8217;s principles and teachings. Hence, our greatest need today is not more Christianity but more true Christians. The world can argue against Christianity as an institution, but there is no convincing argument against a person who, through the Spirit of God, has been made Christlike. Such a person is a living rebuke to the selfishness, rationalism, and materialism of the day. Jesus said to the woman at Jacob&#8217;s well, &#8220;Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst.&#8221; This sin-sick, disillusioned woman was the symbol of the whole race. Her longings were our longings! Her heart-cry was our heart-cry! Her disillusionment was our disillusionment! Her sin was our sin! But her Savior can be our Savior! Her forgiveness can be our forgiveness! Her joy can be our joy!</p>
