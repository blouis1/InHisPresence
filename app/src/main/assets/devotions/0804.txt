<h1>Where is Your Treasure?</h1>

<aside>You cannot serve two masters: God and money.<br />&mdash;Matthew 6:24 (TLB)</aside><p>Tell me what you think about money, and I will tell you what you think about God, for these two are closely related. A man&#8217;s heart is closer to his wallet than anything else. It is a staggering fact that for the past few years people have spent ten times as much for luxuries and non-essentials as they have for all charitable and religious purposes. This is a commentary on our shallow and superficial religious faith.</p>
<p>While the Bible warns us against greed and selfishness, it does encourage frugality and thrift. Even Jesus said to His disciples after He fed the multitude, &#8220;Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.&#8221; Although our Lord had the power to create, He Himself lived frugally and without luxury. John Wesley had a threefold philosophy about money. He said, &#8220;Make all you can; keep all you can; and give all you can.&#8221; Most of us get all we can, spend all we can; borrow all we can; and give meagerly to God.</p>
