<h1>Why We Have the Bible</h1>

<aside>These are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God . . . <br />&mdash;John 20:31</aside><p>God caused the Bible to be written for the express purpose of revealing to us God&#8217;s plan for His redemption. God caused the Book to be written that He might make His everlasting laws clear to His children, and that they might have His great wisdom to guide them, and His great love to comfort them as they make their way through life. For without the Bible this world would indeed be a dark and frightening place, without signpost or beacon. The Bible easily qualifies as the only book in which God&#8217;s revelation is contained.</p>
<p>There are many bibles of different religions; there is the Mohammedan Koran, the Buddhist Canon of Sacred Scripture, the Zoroastrian Zend-Avesta, and the Brahman Veda . . . They all begin with some flashes of true light, and end in utter darkness. Even the most casual observer soon discovers that the Bible is radically different. It is the only Book that offers redemption to us and points the way out of our dilemma.</p>
