<h1>Working Together For Good</h1>

<aside>We know that all things work together for good to them that love God . . . <br />&mdash;Romans 8:28</aside><p>We might never have had the songs of Fanny Crosby had she not been afflicted with blindness. George Matheson would never have given the world his immortal song, &#8220;O Love That Will Not Let Me Go,&#8221; had it not been for his passing through the furnace of affliction. The &#8220;Hallelujah Chorus&#8221; was written by George Frederick Handel when he was poverty-stricken and suffering from a paralyzed right side and right arm. Affliction may be for our edification and Christian development. Sickness is one of the &#8220;all things&#8221; which work together for good to them that love God. Don&#8217;t resent it. Don&#8217;t be embittered by it.</p>
