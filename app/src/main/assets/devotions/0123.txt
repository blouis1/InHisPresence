<h1>Wait Upon the Lord</h1>

<aside>Glory in the Lord; O worshipers of God, rejoice. Search for him and for his strength, and keep on searching!<br />&mdash;Psalm 105:3,4 (TLB)</aside><p>Jerome, one of the early Christians, said, &#8220;Ignorance of the Bible means ignorance of Christ.&#8221; Job once said, &#8220;I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.&#8221; Jeremiah said, &#8220;Thy words were found and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart.&#8221; To read the Bible one needs a &#8220;quiet time.&#8221; Christian students often ask, &#8220;How do you maintain your spiritual high? What do you do on a daily basis?&#8221; I tell them about my &#8220;quiet time.&#8221; Some days it is in the early-sometimes late-morning, sometimes evening. Without it, my Christian life would be a wilderness. Isaiah said, &#8220;They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles, they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint&#8221; (Isaiah 40:31). So gain the strength of eagles, as the prophet suggested. Set a time each day when you can spend a few minutes alone with God.</p>
