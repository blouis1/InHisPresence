<h1>The Eternal Fact</h1>

<aside>And all who trust him—God's Son—to save them have eternal life . . . <br />&mdash;John 3:36 (TLB)</aside><p>Currently, Christianity is being compared with other religions as never before. Some so-called Christian leaders even advocate the working out of a system of morals, ethics, and religion that would bring together all the religions of the world. It cannot be done. Jesus Christ is unique. Why insist on the uniqueness of Christ? What did Christ bring into the world that had not appeared before? The Christian answer is that He is the supreme manifestation of God. &#8220;God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself&#8221; (2 Corinthians 5:19). This is the eternal fact of our Christian faith.</p>
