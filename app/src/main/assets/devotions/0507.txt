<h1>Truth Brings Freedom</h1>

<aside>If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.<br />&mdash;John 8:36</aside><p>The mark of a true Christian is found in his personal relationship to the Person of Jesus Christ. Christianity is Christ. Christ is Christianity. I speak reverently when I say that Jesus is more than His ideas. All that He said was true, but without Him even the truth would have been powerless. Men know the power of truth, and truth is that which sets men free. Jesus said, &#8220;I am the truth.&#8221;</p>
