<h1>All He Requires</h1>

<aside>Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?<br />&mdash;John 11:40</aside><p>If you are a young man or young woman hooked on dissent or despair, ready to split, then lend me your attention. My answer concerns your dreams, and the element in your make-up called &#8220;faith.&#8221; All that God requires of anyone in taking his first step toward Him and toward total self-fulfillment is faith—faith in His Word, that teaches that God loves you and that you were alienated from Him by sin, that Jesus Christ died on the cross for you, that when you make a personal surrender to Him as Lord and Savior, He can transform you from the inside out.</p>
