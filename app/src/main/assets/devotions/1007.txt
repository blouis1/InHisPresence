<h1>Forever Linked</h1>

<aside>. . . this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.<br />&mdash;John 4:42</aside><p>History, philosophy, theology, and—in many centers of learning—even the sciences are being studied to discover what they have to say about Jesus Christ. The records of the Early Church are being reexamined for their testimony to Him. Archaeologists are digging to discover new evidence.</p>
<p>Some say that Jesus Christ is a myth, and He never existed in history. Others say that He was merely a man, that there was nothing supernatural about His birth, and that His resurrection was a hallucination. Others talk about a Christless Christianity. Some say that no matter what one thinks about Christ, it does not affect Christianity. They are wrong!</p>
<p>Christianity is forever linked with the Person of Christ. Carlyle recognized this when he said, &#8220;Had this doctrine of the deity of Christ been lost, Christianity would have vanished like a dream.&#8221; The historian Lecky remarks, &#8220;Christianity is not a system of morals, it is the worship of a Person.&#8221;</p>
