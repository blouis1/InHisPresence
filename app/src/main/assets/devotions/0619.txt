<h1>Distance Makes the Heart Grow Fonder</h1>

<aside>. . . set your sights on the rich treasures and joys of heaven . . . <br />&mdash;Colossians 3:1 (TLB)</aside><p>Have you ever been separated from someone you love? A boyfriend or girlfriend whom you have not seen in three or four months? Wait until you see each other! My wife and I have said goodbyes to each other; but when we met again, it was a honeymoon all over again. And that is what it will be like on that glorious day when Jesus Christ comes. We will be caught up in the air to meet Him, and it will be like two lovers coming together. What hope we have!</p>
