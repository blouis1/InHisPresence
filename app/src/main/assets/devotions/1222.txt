<h1>The Giver of the Gift</h1>

<aside>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not . . . freely give us all things?<br />&mdash;Romans 8:32</aside><p>God is the Giver of the gift. The capability of the donor usually gauges the value of the gift. We don&#8217;t usually think of a person as a gift, but actually interpersonal relationships are the most valued and cherished gifts of all. But the Bible teaches that God gave a Person as a gift to every one of us, and that Person is Jesus Christ. One day a six-year-old boy in a southern town answered a knock at the door.</p>
<p>It was his father, just returned from Southeast Asia. He didn&#8217;t ask, &#8220;Daddy, what did you bring me?&#8221; He threw his arms around his father&#8217;s neck and said, &#8220;Oh, Daddy, this is the best Christmas present I&#8217;ve ever had!&#8221;</p>
