<h1>No Reason to Hurry</h1>

<aside>When your patience is finally in full bloom, then you will be ready for anything, strong in character . . . <br />&mdash;James 1:4 (TLB)</aside><p>This is a high-strung, neurotic, impatient age. We hurry when there is no reason to hurry—just to be hurrying. This fast-paced age has produced more problems and less morality than previous generations, and it has given all of us jangled nerves. Impatience has produced a new crop of broken homes, or more new ulcers, and has set the stage for more world wars.</p>
