<h1>All Have Sinned</h1>

<aside>So it is that we are saved by faith in Christ and not by the good things we do.<br />&mdash;Romans 3:28 (TLB)</aside><p>Many people still cling to the notion that man is naturally good. We did not get this from the Greeks. Aristotle said, &#8220;There is no good in mankind.&#8221; We did not get it from Judaism. Jeremiah said, &#8220;The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?&#8221; (Jeremiah 17:9). </p>
<p>We did not get it from Christian teachings. The Apostle Paul said, &#8220;All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God&#8221; (Romans 3:23). We got this illusion, I believe, from the philosophers and psychologists of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries who taught the false doctrine that man is a helpless victim of his environment. </p>
<p>The Bible says that man is not naturally good. All human experience confirms it. Man is rebellious by nature. This first rebellion in history happened in the Garden of Eden, where the environment was perfect and there was no heredity on which to blame it!</p>
