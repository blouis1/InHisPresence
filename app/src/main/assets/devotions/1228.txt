<h1>Cure for Our Troubles</h1>

<aside>. . . preaching peace by Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all).<br />&mdash;Acts 10:36</aside><p>Would it not be wonderful if we could find an absolute cure for the troubles of human nature? Suppose we could give a shot in the arm to the whole human race that would fill people with love instead of hate, with contentment instead of greed. Suppose, also, a cure could be found for the past mistakes, failures, and sins of mankind.</p>
<p>Suppose by some miracle all the past could be straightened out, all of life&#8217;s tangles could be unraveled, and the broken strings of life could be repaired. The most thrilling news in all the world is the fact that there is a cure! A medicine has been provided! The sin, confusion, and disillusionment of life can be replaced by righteousness, joy, contentment, and happiness. A peace can be imparted to the soul that is not dependent on outward circumstances.</p>
