<h1>Do not trust your heart</h1>

<aside>And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him . . . <br />&mdash;Luke 23:33</aside><p>One of the ironies of human nature is that it often has a way of rejecting the best and accepting the worst. Why did the crowd ask for the release of Barabbas and the crucifixion of Jesus? The answer is in the biblical statement, &#8220;The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.&#8221; Jesus is just as divine today and just as much alive as He was on that first Good Friday. Yet millions today don&#8217;t accept Him. His goodness is still a rebuke to our badness; His purity still shows up our impurities; His sinlessness still reveals our sinfulness; and unless we allow Him to destroy the evil within us, the evil within us still wants to destroy Him. This is the conflict of the ages.</p>
