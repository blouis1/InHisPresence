<h1>Science and Religion</h1>

<aside>He reveals profound mysteries beyond man's understanding. He knows all hidden things, for he is light . . . <br />&mdash;Daniel 2:22 (TLB)</aside><p>The fact of the matter is that science and faith complement each other, and there is no conflict between true science and true religion. Together they give the best foundation for wholesome faith and courage for daily living. When Galileo, the father of modern science, discovered that the earth revolved, instead of the sun moving around the earth, certain religious leaders were greatly disturbed, for they held another theory. But eventually they were reconciled.</p>
<p>Since that day we have happily found that true science is compatible with a deep religious faith. So Christianity is what we might term: supra-scientific. There are highways beyond science that lead to truth. Christ Jesus was the Master of spiritual truth, and He imparts these truths to us-as we work out a working relationship with Him.</p>
