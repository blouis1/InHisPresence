<h1>God Made Us Unique</h1>

<aside>Our soul waiteth for the Lord . . . <br />&mdash;Psalm 33:20</aside><p>I am a soul—and I have a body! The body is the house in which the soul lives. When Oliver Wendell Holmes was in his 80th year, a friend hailed him and asked, &#8220;How are you?&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m fine,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;the house I live in is tottering and crumbling, but Oliver Wendell Holmes is fine, thank you.&#8221; In this materialistic age we often forget that the real, the abiding part of us is invisible. Much time, money, and effort are expended to perpetuate the physical part of us, and too many are unconcerned about their spiritual health and nurture. Hence doctors&#8217; offices are overcrowded, and many ministers&#8217; counseling rooms are empty.</p>
<p>When God created man, He made him distinctive, different from the other animals. &#8220;He breathed into him the breath of life and man became a living soul.&#8221; He clothed him with intelligence, conscience, and a will. He made him like Himself—a companion, a friend of God. At the resurrection, this mortal shall put on immortality, and we shall be like Him, and be with Him forever.</p>
