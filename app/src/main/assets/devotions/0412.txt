<h1>Shine Your Light</h1>

<aside>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.<br />&mdash;Matthew 5:16</aside><p>One faithful witness is worth a thousand mute professors of religion. Tom Allan, Scotland&#8217;s famous young preacher, was brought to Christ while a black soldier was singing, &#8220;Were You There When They Crucified My Lord?&#8221; He said it was neither the song nor the voice, but the spirit in which that soldier sang—something about his manner, something about his sincerity of expression—that convicted him of his wicked life and turned him to the Savior. Our faith grows by expression. If we want to keep our faith, we must share it—we must witness.</p>
