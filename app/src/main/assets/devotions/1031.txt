<h1>Hope for the Future</h1>

<aside>For our citizenship is in heaven; from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.<br />&mdash;Philippians 3:20 (NASB)</aside><p>If you are moving to a new home, you want to know all about the community to which you are going. And since we will spend eternity some place, we ought to know something about it. The information concerning heaven is found in the Bible. When we talk about heaven, earth grows shabby by comparison. Our sorrows and problems here seem so much less, when we have keen anticipation of the future.</p>
<p>In a certain sense the Christian has heaven here on earth. He has peace of soul, peace of conscience, and peace with God. In the midst of troubles and difficulties he can smile. He has a spring in his step, a joy in his soul, a smile on his face. But the Bible also promises the Christian a heaven in the life hereafter.</p>
