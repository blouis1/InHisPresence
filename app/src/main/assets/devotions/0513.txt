<h1>God Provides</h1>

<aside>Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.<br />&mdash;John 13:13</aside><p>He (the Spirit) will never lead you contrary to the Word of God. I hear people saying, &#8220;The Lord led me to do this. . . . The Lord told me thus and so . . . &#8221; I am always a little suspicious unless what the Lord has said is in keeping with His Word. God never directs us to do anything contrary to His Word. The prophet Samuel once said, &#8220;Obedience is better than sacrifice.&#8221; The Scripture teaches, &#8220;He that willeth to do His will shall know the doctrine.&#8221; When you find yourself up a blind alley, not knowing which way to turn, if you are willing to do His will, He will reveal Himself. He conceals His will only from those who, before they consent to do His bidding, seek to know what He is going to say. Be an obedient Christian. Remember that &#8220;where God guides, He provides. Where He leads, He supplies all needs!&#8221;</p>
