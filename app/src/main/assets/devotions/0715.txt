<h1>Disappointment Becomes Joy</h1>

<aside>They shall see his face . . . <br />&mdash;Revelation 22:4 (TLB)</aside><p>One of the great bonuses of being a Christian is the great hope that extends beyond the grave into the glory of God&#8217;s tomorrow. A little girl was running toward a cemetery as the darkness of evening began to fall. She passed a friend who asked her if she was not afraid to go through the graveyard at night. &#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid. My home is just on the other side!&#8221; We Christians are not afraid of the night of death because our heavenly home is &#8220;just on the other side.&#8221; The resurrection of Christ changed the midnight of bereavement into a sunrise of reunion; it changed the midnight of disappointment into a sunrise of joy; it changed the midnight of fear to a sunrise of peace. Today faith and confidence in the resurrected Christ can change your fear to hope and your disappointment to joy.</p>
