<h1>Symptoms of Guilt</h1>

<aside>Cleanse me from this guilt. Let me be pure again.<br />&mdash;Psalm 51:2 (TLB)</aside><p>Guilt is a prominent word among psychoanalysts, psychiatrists, and ministers too. The dictionary calls guilt &#8220;the act or state of having done a wrong or committed an offense.&#8221; The symptoms of guilt are many, but the root cause is one.</p>
<p>We have broken the moral law of the universe as expressed in the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount. So we have a sense of guilt.</p>
<p>This guilt causes a variety of psychological problems such as insecurity, tension, hunger for approval, struggles for recognition. A sense of guilt, some psychiatrists point out, is as necessary as a sense of pain. We need both in order to keep us from getting hurt.</p>
