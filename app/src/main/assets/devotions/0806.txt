<h1>Ills of the Human Race</h1>

<aside>Set thy house in order . . . <br />&mdash;2 Kings 20:1</aside><p>Man condemns himself by his refusal of God&#8217;s way of salvation. In love and mercy, God is offering to men and women a way of escape, a way of salvation, a hope and anticipation of better things. Man in his blindness, stupidity, stubbornness, egotism, and love of sinful pleasure, refuses God&#8217;s simple method of escaping the pangs of eternal banishment. Suppose you were sick and called a doctor who came and gave you a prescription. But after thinking it over you decided to ignore his advice and to refuse the medicine. When he returned a few days later, he might have found your condition much worse. Could you blame the doctor? Could you hold him responsible? He gave you the prescription, he prescribed the remedy. But you refused it!</p>
<p>Just so, God prescribes the remedy for the ills of the human race. That remedy is personal faith in, and commitment to, Jesus Christ. The remedy is to be &#8220;born again.&#8221; If we deliberately refuse it, then we must suffer the consequence; and we cannot blame God. Is it God&#8217;s fault that we refuse the remedy?</p>
