<h1>The Truth Sets Us Free</h1>

<aside>Come unto me, all ye that labor . . . <br />&mdash;Matthew 11:28</aside><p>The mark of a true Christian is found in his personal relationship to  the Person of Jesus Christ. Christianity is Christ. Christ is  Christianity. I speak reverently when I say that Jesus is more than His  ideas. All that He said was true, but without Him even the truth would  have been powerless. Men know the power of truth, and truth is that  which sets men free. Jesus said, &#8220;I am the truth.&#8221;</p>
