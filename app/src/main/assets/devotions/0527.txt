<h1>A Sacred Institution</h1>

<aside>Follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.<br />&mdash;Romans 14:19</aside><p>The home is basically a sacred institution. The perfect marriage is the uniting of three persons&#8211;a man and a woman and God. This is what makes marriage holy. Faith in Christ is the most important of all principles in the building of a happy marriage and a successful home. The secret strength of a nation is found in the faith that abides in the hearts and homes of the country.</p>
