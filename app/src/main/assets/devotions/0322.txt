<h1>A Pure Heart</h1>

<aside>Keep thyself pure.<br />&mdash;1 Timothy 5:22</aside><p>The Pharisees were not happy men. They had furrowed brows, nervous tension, frustration. They were full of resentments, bitterness, prejudices, and hatreds. Why? Simply because they had lost sight of God&#8217;s conception of the pure in heart. They thought that as long as they kept the letter of the law that was enough. But this was not God&#8217;s plan. This did not produce purity of heart. This did not bring about happiness of soul. Jesus taught that God looks deeper than the outside actions of an individual. He searches and ponders the heart. God judges not so much the outside as He does the inside. He looks to the motives, thoughts, and intents of your heart.</p>
