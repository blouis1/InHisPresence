<h1>Forgiveness in Marriage</h1>

<aside>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br />&mdash;1 John 1:9</aside><p>It is unfortunate in a marriage if there is an array of sordid memories of past sins on the part of either partner. If young people could only realize that a happy marriage depends not only on the present, but upon the past, they would be more reluctant to enter into loose, intimate relations with anyone and everyone. Many a marriage has been imperiled by the backlash of past sins, which were not just confessed, but &#8220;found out.&#8221;</p>
<p>As to the necessity of confessing past sins to one&#8217;s mate, I don&#8217;t think it is always advisable or necessary. I have known of homes that were wrecked by such confessions. The main thing is to confess any past wrongs to God, resolve to be true to your marriage vows; and absolve the black past by a spotless present.</p>
