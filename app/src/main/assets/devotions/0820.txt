<h1>Three Kinds of Pleasure</h1>

<aside>The disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.<br />&mdash;Acts 13:52</aside><p>The Bible speaks of three kinds of pleasure. There is lustful pleasure, the lust of the flesh, and Scripture says it is sinful and wrong. There is legitimate pleasure, which is not wrong, but we are not to become so preoccupied with its activities that it takes the place of God. Then there is a third kind of pleasure, lasting pleasure. Do you have that kind? It does not depend on circumstances or feelings. It is the pleasure that runs deep and comes from the Spirit of God.</p>
