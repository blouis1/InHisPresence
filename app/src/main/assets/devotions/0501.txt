<h1>God, The Peacekeeper</h1>

<aside>He will keep in perfect peace all those who trust in him, whose thoughts turn often to the Lord!<br />&mdash;Isaiah 26:3 (TLB)</aside><p>You have an ego-a consciousness of being an individual. Of course, you do. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that you are to worship yourself, to think constantly of yourself, and to live entirely for yourself. Common sense tells you that your life would be miserable if you followed that course. God is infinitely more concerned about your happiness than you could possibly be. He says, &#8220;Deny yourself, and follow me.&#8221; There is many a person in the insane asylum today who thought excessively about himself, to the exclusion of God and others. Hypochondriacs who have a fanciful anxiety about their health will never be well, regardless of their physical condition.</p>
