<h1>He Can Use Anyone</h1>

<aside>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.<br />&mdash;Philippians 1:21</aside><p>Helen Keller, who is a classic example of handling life&#8217;s handicaps, said, &#8220;I thank God for my handicaps, for through them I have found myself, my work, and my God.&#8221; Some people with handicaps drown themselves in self-pity, and thus limit their usefulness and service to mankind and to God. The Apostle Paul knew the pangs of suffering. He used his infirmity rather than allowing his infirmity to use him, and he used it for the glory of God. He seized everything, even death, to glorify his Lord. No matter which way fate turned, he was one jump ahead of it, and using it to magnify his Savior.</p>
