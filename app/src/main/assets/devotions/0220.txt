<h1>Overcome Temptation</h1>

<aside>Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.<br />&mdash;Psalm 119:11</aside><p>When temptations come, let me suggest that you ask God for strength-and also to show you the way He has prepared for your escape. One other word of counsel; be very sure that you do not deliberately place yourself in a position to be tempted. All of us are not subjected to the same weaknesses and temptations. To one, alcohol may be the temptation; to another, it may be impure thoughts and acts; to another, greed and covetousness; to another, criticism and an unloving attitude. Regardless of what it may be, be sure that Satan will tempt you at your weak point, not the strong. Our Lord has given us an example of how to overcome the devil&#8217;s temptations. When He was tempted in the wilderness, He defeated Satan every time by the use of the Bible.</p>
