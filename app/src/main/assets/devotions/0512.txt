<h1>He Changes Us</h1>

<aside>. . . that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel.<br />&mdash;Ephesians 6:19</aside><p>The word &#8220;mystery&#8221; means beyond human knowledge or understanding. God&#8217;s mysteries baffle the unbelieving, but bless the believer. The mystery of righteousness, like some of the other great mysteries of God, we cannot comprehend, but we know it works. We stand amazed at this great mystery which enables God to change the human heart, its attitudes, its desires, and its nature.</p>
<p>God, a holy God, who loves righteousness and hates wickedness, through a process of redemption has refashioned us in the image of Himself. How marvelous! For generations He has been applying His righteousness to the hearts of men. Even in our time, with its complexities of living, God is in the business of changing men and women by the mystery of righteousness.</p>
