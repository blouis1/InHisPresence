<h1>Cast Your Cares</h1>

<aside>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the [children] of God . . . <br />&mdash;1 John 3:1</aside><p>As God&#8217;s children, we are His dependents. The Bible says, &#8220;Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him.&#8221; Dependent children spend little time worrying about meals, clothing, and shelter. They assume, and they have a right to, that all will be provided by their parents. Because God is responsible for our welfare, we are told to cast all our care upon Him, for He careth for us.</p>
<p>Because we are dependent upon God, Jesus said, &#8220;Let not your heart be troubled.&#8221; God says, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take care of the burden—don&#8217;t give it a thought—leave it to me.&#8221; Dependent children are not backward about asking for favors. They would not be normal if they did not boldly make their needs known. God is keenly aware that we are dependent upon Him for life&#8217;s necessities. It was for that reason that He said, &#8220;Ask, and it shall be given you; seek and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.&#8221;</p>
