<h1>Standing Firm</h1>

<aside>So use every piece of God's armor to resist the enemy whenever he attacks, and when it is all over, you will still be standing up.<br />&mdash;Ephesians 6:13 (TLB)</aside><p>Daniel and his companions were tempted to forsake their godly heritage, but they refused. They even faced a fiery furnace rather than compromise. God honored their faith and mightily used them. Moses was surrounded by the luxury and godlessness of the Egyptian court, but cast in his lot with his own people. Lot lived in Sodom and saw the obscenities of that doomed city. God saved him out of it because he trusted in Him. Every one of our Lord&#8217;s apostles sealed their faith with their lives. Since then, history has been replete with the lives of men who have put God and His way of life above all else.</p>
