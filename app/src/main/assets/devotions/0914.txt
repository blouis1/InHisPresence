<h1>True Friendship</h1>

<aside>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.<br />&mdash;John 13:35</aside><p>The human soul is a lonely thing. It must have the assurance of companionship. Left entirely to itself, it cannot enjoy anything. God said in the beginning, &#8220;It is not good that man should dwell alone&#8221; (Genesis 2:18). The creation of Eve was the beginning of human companionship. God&#8217;s people are a body, not intended to function separately, not intended to be unconcerned for one another. The only true body in the world is the Church. The world may talk grandly of brotherhood, but in reality its philosophy is &#8220;each man for himself.&#8221; God&#8217;s children are guaranteed the richest and truest friendship, both here and hereafter. Only in a true friendship and a true love do we find a genuine basis for peace. Only God can break down the national and racial barriers that divide men today. Only God can supply that love that we must have for our fellowman. We will never build brotherhood of man upon earth until we are believers in Christ Jesus. The only true cohesive power in the world is Christ. He alone can bind human hearts together in genuine love.</p>
