<h1>Joy in Sorrow</h1>

<aside>In the day when I cried, [you] answered me, and strengthened me ...<br />&mdash;Psalm 138:3</aside><p>At some time in life all of us feel the loneliness of sorrow. Mary and Martha were saddened by the death of their brother, Lazarus, and Martha said to Jesus, &#8220;If you had been here, my brother would not have died.&#8221; Theirs was a loneliness of sorrow. The shortest verse in the Bible tells us that at the tomb of Lazarus &#8220;Jesus wept.&#8221; He enters into our sorrows.</p>
<p>When we come to Jesus Christ, He does not promise to exempt us from trouble or sorrow. Tears will come, but deep inside there will be a joy that is difficult to explain to you. It is a joy from God—produced by the Holy Spirit. In the midst of trials and agony and tears which come to us all, a supernatural power is given out, producing joy.</p>
