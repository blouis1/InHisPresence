<h1>Steadfast Love</h1>

<aside>Your steadfast love, O Lord, is as great as all the heavens . . . <br />&mdash;Psalm 36:5 (TLB)</aside><p>Young people talk a lot about love. Most of their songs are about love. . . . &#8220;The supreme happiness of life,&#8221; Victor Hugo said long ago, &#8220;is the conviction that we are loved.&#8221; &#8220;Love is the first requirement for mental health,&#8221; declared Sigmund Freud. The Bible teaches that &#8220;God is love&#8221; and that God loves you. To realize that is of paramount importance. Nothing else matters so much. And loving you, God has a wonderful plan for your life. Who else could plan and guide your life so well?</p>
