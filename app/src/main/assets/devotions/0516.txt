<h1>Mindful of the Leading of God</h1>

<aside>Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.<br />&mdash;Galatians 3:24</aside><p>When God gave the law, He knew that man was incapable of keeping it. Many persons are confused as to why God gave the law, if He knew man could not possibly keep it. The Bible teaches that the law was given as a mirror; I look into the law and see my spiritual condition. I see how far short I come, and this drives me to the cross of Christ for forgiveness. The Bible teaches that this is why Christ came-to redeem them that were under the law. Man could not keep the law; he was condemned by the law.</p>
