<h1>Sanctity of Marriage</h1>

<aside>How I need your help, especially in my own home . . . <br />&mdash;Psalm 101:2 (TLB)</aside><p>In the marriage ceremony, after the vows are said, the minister solemnly and reverently remarks, &#8220;What God hath joined together let no man put asunder.&#8221; Is not God the third part in a marriage? Should He not be taken into account in the marriage, and in the home that emerges from that marriage? If God joins the couple together at the outset, should not His presence be recognized in the home continually? Many homes are on the rocks today because God has been left out of the domestic picture.</p>
<p>With the clash of personalities in a domestic pattern, there must be an integrating force, and the living God is that Force! Many couples think that if they have a better home, get a better job, or live in a different neighborhood, their domestic life will be happier. No! The secret of domestic happiness is to let God, the party of the third part in the marriage contract, have His rightful place in the home. Make peace with Him, and then you can be a real peacemaker in the home.</p>
