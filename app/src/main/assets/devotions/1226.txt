<h1>Where Does Your Hope Lie?</h1>

<aside>Blessed is the man who trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is.<br />&mdash;Jeremiah 17:7</aside><p>The Scriptures predict that a new day is coming. There will be a golden age of prosperity when all perplexing problems-religious, social, or political-will find their complete solution. It will be a marvelous time for this mixed-up world. However, the Bible teaches that man will not bring about this coming golden age. Man alone cannot. The flaw in human nature is too great. Man has no ability to repair this damaged planet. God is our only hope! His plans are already formed, and they are perfectly stated in the Scriptures.</p>
