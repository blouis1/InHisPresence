<h1>God is in Nature</h1>

<aside>When I consider thy heavens . . . <br />&mdash;Psalm 8:3</aside><p>To look into a microscope is to see another universe so small that only the electronic microscope can even find it. For instance, it is revealed that one single snowflake in a snowstorm with millions of other snowflakes is the equivalent of twenty billion electrons. Scientists are learning that the miniature world of a single living cell is as astonishing as man himself. God says that we can learn a great deal about Him just by observing nature. Because He has spoken through His universe, all men are without excuse for not believing in Him. This is why the Psalmist said, &#8220;The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God&#8221; (Psalm 14:1).</p>
