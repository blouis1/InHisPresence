<h1>No Regrets</h1>

<aside>If we are living now by the Holy Spirit's power, let us follow the Holy Spirit's leading in every part of our lives.<br />&mdash;Galatians 5:25 (TLB)</aside><p>When Bill Borden, son of the wealthy Bordens, went out to China as a missionary, many of his friends thought he was foolish to &#8220;waste his life,&#8221; as they put it, trying to convert a few heathens to Christianity. But Bill loved Christ and he loved men! He hadn&#8217;t been out there very long before he contracted an oriental disease and died. At his bedside they found a note that he had written while he was dying. It read, &#8220;No reserve, no retreat, and no regrets.&#8221; Bill had found more happiness in his few years of sacrificial service than most people find in a lifetime.</p>
