<h1>Be Truthful</h1>

<aside>You deserve honesty from the heart; yes, utter sincerity and truthfulness. Oh, give me this wisdom.<br />&mdash;Psalm 51:6 (TLB)</aside><p>The Bible teaches that purity of conduct includes truthfulness. The Bible teaches that we should be truthful in our representation of ourselves. With what scorn Christ denounced the hypocrisy of the scribes and Pharisees! In the Sermon on the Mount He rebuked all hypocritical giving, praying, and fasting. We should also be truthful in speaking of our past achievements in our particular vocation. God does not ask us to understate the facts-that might even be untruthfulness-but neither does He want us to overrate our achievements or our gifts, either in thought or in speech. A lie is anything contrary to the naked truth.</p>
