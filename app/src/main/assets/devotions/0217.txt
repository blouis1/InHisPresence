<h1>Our Eternal Home</h1>

<aside>I create new heavens . . . <br />&mdash;Isaiah 65:17</aside><p>What kind of place is heaven?</p>
<p>First, heaven is home. The Bible takes the word &#8220;home&#8221; with all of its tender associations and with all of its sacred memories and tells us that heaven is home. Second, heaven is a home which is permanent. We have the promise of a home where Christ&#8217;s followers will remain forever. Third, the Bible teaches that heaven is a home which is beautiful beyond every imagination. Heaven could not help but be so, because God is a God of beauty. Fourth, the Bible teaches that heaven will be a home which is happy, because there will be nothing to make it sad. In heaven families and friends will be reunited. God&#8217;s house will be a happy home because Christ will be there. He will be the center of heaven. To Him all hearts will turn, and upon Him all eyes will rest.</p>
