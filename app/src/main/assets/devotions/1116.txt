<h1>Real Security</h1>

<aside>The foundation of God standeth sure . . . <br />&mdash;2 Timothy 2:19</aside><p>On campus the quickest way to security is through the crowd. Precisely where students talk about being independent and on their own, you will find them practicing the most rigid conformity in dress, in speech, in moral attitudes, and in thinking. Sometimes they follow fashion at the expense of integrity. They dread to be alone. They do not want to stand out or be different. They want to conform.</p>
<p>After they graduate from college, many of these young people want nothing more than a good job with a big firm, and a home somewhere in suburbia. But they don&#8217;t find security then either. Only Jesus Christ can give you the security that you are looking for.</p>
