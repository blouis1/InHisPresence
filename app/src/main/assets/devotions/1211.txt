<h1>What is Idolatry?</h1>

<aside>Whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father . . . <br />&mdash;Matthew 10:33</aside><p>What is idolatry? Idolatry is anything that comes between us and God. Joshua told his people that their nation would be destroyed if they persisted in idolatry, and their souls would suffer eternal death. He said, &#8220;You must make your decision today. You must decide whether you want to serve the idols of this life, or the living God.&#8221; &#8220;Choose you this day,&#8221; said Joshua, &#8220;as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.&#8221; What about you? Are you taking your stand with Joshua? No matter what the cost? I am asking you to choose this day whom you will serve. Our families cannot choose Christ for us. Our friends cannot do it. God is a great God, but even God can&#8217;t make the decision for us. He can help, but only we can decide. We have to make our own choice.</p>
