<h1>Molding You</h1>

<aside>When we suffer and die for Christ it only means that we will begin living with him in heaven.<br />&mdash;2 Timothy 2:11 (TLB)</aside><p>I have a friend who during the Depression lost his job, a fortune, a wife, and a home. But he tenaciously held to his faith-the only thing he had left. One day he stopped to watch some men doing stonework on a huge church. One of them was chiseling a triangular piece of stone. &#8220;What are you going to do with that?&#8221; asked my friend. The workman said, &#8220;See that little opening away up there near the spire? Well, I&#8217;m shaping this down here, so it will fit in up there.&#8221; Tears filled the eyes of my friend as he walked away, for it seemed that God had spoken through the workman to explain his ordeal through which he was passing, &#8220;I&#8217;m shaping you down here, so you&#8217;ll fit in up there.&#8221;</p>
