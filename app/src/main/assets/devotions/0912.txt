<h1>Be Meek – Be Happy</h1>

<aside>Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth.<br />&mdash;Matthew 5:5</aside><p>In His characteristic way Jesus was saying something quite shocking and revolutionary to His listener with these words, &#8220;Happy are the meek.&#8221; He was saying something quite the opposite of our modern concept of the way to happiness. We say, &#8220;Happy are the clever, for they shall inherit the admiration of their friends&#8221;; &#8220;Happy are the aggressive, for they shall inherit a career&#8221;; &#8220;Happy are the rich, for they shall inherit a world of friends and a house full of modern gadgets.&#8221; Jesus did not say, &#8220;Be meek and you shall inherit the earth.&#8221; He, more than anyone else, knew that meekness was a gift of God, a result of rebirth. Jesus was not issuing a command in this Beatitude nor saying, &#8220;You ought to be meek, that is the way to live.&#8221; No! He was saying that if we want to find the secret of happiness, that if we want to enjoy living, then &#8220;meekness&#8221; is a basic key.</p>
