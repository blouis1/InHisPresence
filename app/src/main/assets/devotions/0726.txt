<h1>The End of Life</h1>

<aside>. . . willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.<br />&mdash;2 Corinthians 5:8</aside><p>A little boy was riding alone on a train on a hot day when the travelers were extremely uncomfortable; and the scenery was not too interesting as they passed through the desert of Arizona. A lady sitting beside the boy asked him, &#8220;Are you tired of the long ride?&#8221; The little boy smiled and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m a little tired, but I don&#8217;t mind it much. You see, my father is going to meet me when I get to Los Angeles.&#8221; Sometimes we get a little tired of the burdens of life, but it is exhilarating to know that Jesus Christ will meet us at the end of life&#8217;s journey. The joy of being with Him forever is beyond the ability of any writer to describe.</p>
