<h1>Cast Your Cares</h1>

<aside>Look at the birds! They don't worry about what to eat-they don't need to sow or reap or store up food-for your heavenly Father feeds them. And you are far more valuable to him than they are.<br />&mdash;Matthew 6:26 (TLB)</aside><p>Some section hands on a British railroad found a thrush&#8217;s nest under a rail. Peacefully sitting on her eggs, the hen was undisturbed by the roar of the fast trains above and around her. Someone has written a little verse which goes:</p>
<p>&#8220;Said the robin to the sparrow,<br />
&#8216;I should really like to know,<br />
Why these anxious human beings<br />
Rush about and worry so.&#8217;<br />
Said the sparrow to the robin,<br />
&#8216;Friend, I think that it must be,<br />
That they have no heavenly Father<br />
Such as cares for you and me.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Jesus used the carefree attitude of the birds to underscore the fact that worrying is unnatural. I am learning in my own life, day by day, to keep my mind centered on Christ, and the worries and anxieties and concerns of the world pass, and nothing but &#8220;perfect peace&#8221; is left in the human heart. God has taken the responsibility for our care and worry.</p>
