<h1>Being Rich</h1>

<aside>Real life and real living are not related to how rich we are.<br />&mdash;Luke 12:15 (TLB)</aside><p>There are two ways of being rich—have a lot, or want very little. The latter way is the easier for most of us. Many people make themselves miserable by wanting more than they can ever have. They suffer from &#8220;thing-itis,&#8221; the insatiable desire for more, better, and newer things. Jesus was the most satisfied man that ever lived, and He had less than most of us. &#8220;The foxes have their holes, and the birds their nests, but the Son of man has no place to lay His head.&#8221; He had learned the secret of adjusting His wants to His needs.</p>
<p>E. Stanley Jones tells about a poor man who had an overnight guest, and as he showed him to his humble bedroom in the hayloft, he said, &#8220;If there is anything you want, let us know, and we&#8217;ll come and show you how to get along without it.&#8221; We don&#8217;t need to learn how to get more, but how to get along with what we&#8217;ve got, and get on with the business of living.</p>
