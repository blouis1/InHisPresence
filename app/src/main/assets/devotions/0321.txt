<h1>Satisfaction in Him</h1>

<aside>I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.<br />&mdash;Psalm 17:15</aside><p>Is it not logical to believe that the only one who can recreate us is the One who created us in the first place? If your watch were out of order, you wouldn&#8217;t take it to a blacksmith. If your car needed overhauling, you wouldn&#8217;t go to a machine shop. Our spiritual problems can be solved only by the God who created us originally. He created us in His own image and likeness; today, by the grace of His Son, He can recreate us in the likeness of His resurrection. Through faith in Jesus Christ, we are recreated and become partakers of His life.</p>
