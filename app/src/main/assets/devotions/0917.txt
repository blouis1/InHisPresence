<h1>The Power of Words</h1>

<aside>The tongue is a small thing, but what enormous damage it can do . . . <br />&mdash;James 3:5 (TLB)</aside><p>There is a story of a woman in England who came to her vicar with a troubled conscience. The vicar knew her to be a habitual gossip—she had maligned nearly everyone in the village. &#8220;How can I make amends?&#8221; she pleaded. The vicar said, &#8220;If you want to make peace with your conscience, take a bag of goose feathers and drop one on the porch of each one you have slandered.&#8221; When she had done so, she came back to the vicar and said, &#8220;Is that all?&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; said the wise old minister, &#8220;you must go now and gather up every feather and bring them all back to me.&#8221; After a long time the woman returned without a single feather. &#8220;The wind has blown them all away,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My good woman,&#8221; said the vicar, &#8220;so it is with gossip. Unkind words are easily dropped, but we can never take them back again.&#8221;</p>
