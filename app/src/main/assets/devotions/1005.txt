<h1>Suffering as a Christian</h1>

<aside>Blessed is the man whom [the Lord] chasteneth . . . <br />&mdash;Psalm 94:12</aside><p>God sometimes allows Christians to suffer, in order that they might learn the secret of obedience. The Psalmist said, &#8220;Before I was afflicted, I went astray; but now have I kept thy word&#8221; (Psalm 119:67). It was not until after great sorrow and much affliction that David learned obedience to God.</p>
<p>My dear Christian friend, if you are today suffering at the hand of God and you have asked a thousand times, &#8220;Why?&#8221; I beg of you to be patient and quiet before God, and listen to the still, small voice. Bow under His loving hand and recognize that above the clouds the sun is shining. God has a purpose and design for your life, and what is happening to you is for your good.</p>
