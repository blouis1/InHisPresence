<h1>Only Jesus</h1>

<aside>God . . . is the one who invited you into this wonderful friendship with his Son, even Christ our Lord.<br />&mdash;1 Corinthians 1:9 (TLB)</aside><p>The question remains, &#8220;How can God be just-that is, true to Himself in nature and true to Himself in holiness-and yet justify the sinner?&#8221; Because each man had to bear his own sins, all mankind was excluded from helping, since each was contaminated with the same disease. The only solution was for an innocent party to volunteer to die physically and spiritually as a substitution before God. This innocent party would have to take man&#8217;s judgment, penalty, and death. But where was such an individual? Certainly, there was none on earth. There was only one possibility. God&#8217;s own Son was the only personality in the universe who had the capacity to bear in His own body the sins of the world. Only God&#8217;s Son was infinite and thus able to die for all.</p>
