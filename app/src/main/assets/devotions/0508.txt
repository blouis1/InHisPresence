<h1>The Influence of a Mother</h1>

<aside>Her children arise up, and call her blessed... <br />&mdash; Proverbs 31:28 </aside><p>Only God Himself fully appreciates the influence of a Christian mother in the molding of character in her children. Someone has said, &#8220;Like mother, like children.&#8221; Most of the noble characters and fine leaders of history have had good, God-fearing mothers. We are told that George Washington&#8217;s mother was pious, and that Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s mother was a lover of poetry and music. On the other hand, we are told that Nero&#8217;s mother was a murderess and that the dissolute Lord Byron&#8217;s mother was a proud and violent woman. The influence of a mother upon the lives of her children cannot be measured. They know and absorb her example and attitudes when it comes to questions of honesty, temperance, kindness, and industry.</p>
