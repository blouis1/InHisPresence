<h1>God Never Makes Mistakes</h1>

<aside>Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.<br />&mdash;2 Corinthians 12:9</aside><p>God is especially close to us when we are lying on a sickbed. God will make the bed soft and will freshen it with His presence and with His tender care. He makes the bed comfortable and wipes away our tears. He ministers to us with special tenderness at such a time and reveals His great love for us. Tell me why the gardener trims and prunes his rosebushes, sometimes cutting away productive branches, and I will tell you why God&#8217;s people are afflicted. God&#8217;s hand never slips. He never makes a mistake. His every move is for our own good and for our ultimate good. Oftentimes He must deform us and mutilate our own image. Deformity sometimes precedes conformity.</p>
