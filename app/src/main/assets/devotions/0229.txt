<h1>You Are Not alone</h1>

<aside>“... for the Lord thy God, He it is that doth go with thee; He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.”<br />&mdash;Deuteronomy 31:6</aside><p>Loneliness is no respecter of persons. It invades the palace as well as the hut. Many turn to drink because of loneliness. Others lose their sanity becasue of loneliness. Many commit suicide because of the despair of loneliness. Thousands have found Christ to be the answer for their loneliness. The Hebrew children were not alone when they were hurled into the fiery furnace of persecution. There was One with them like unto the Son of God. Moses wasn&#8217;t alone in the Midian Desert when God came to comfort him and call him to a wider ministry. Elijah wasn&#8217;t alone at the cave when God came near and spoke with the still, small voice. Paul and Silas were not alone in the Philippian jail when God came down and gave them a song at midnight. Whoever you are, Christ can give you comfort and companionship.</p>
