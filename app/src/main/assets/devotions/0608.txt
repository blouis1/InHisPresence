<h1>Courage to Stand</h1>

<aside>It is no shame to suffer for being a Christian. Praise God for the privilege of being in Christ's family and being called by<BR>his wonderful name!<br />&mdash;1 Peter 4:16 (TLB)</aside><p>A great problem in America is that we have an anemic and watered-down Christianity that has produced an anemic, watered-down, and spineless Christian who is not willing to stand up and be counted on every issue. We must have a virile, dynamic, aggressive Christian who lives Christ seven days a week, who is ready to die, if necessary, for his faith. We need Christians who are ethical, honest, gracious, bold, strong, and devoted followers of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
