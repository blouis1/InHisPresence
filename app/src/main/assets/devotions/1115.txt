<h1>Divine Artistry</h1>

<aside>Yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.<br />&mdash;2 Corinthians 12:5</aside><p>Dr. Edward Judson, in speaking of the life of his father, Adoniram Judson, at the dedication of the Judson Memorial Church in New York City, said, &#8220;Suffering and success go together. If you are succeeding without suffering, it is because others before you have suffered; if you are suffering without succeeding, it is that others after you may succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Happy are they that mourn. They can be happy because they know that their pain, their distress, and their privation are the travail of a new creation, the birth pangs of a better world. They can be happy if they are aware that the Master Artist, God, is employing both light and shadow to produce a masterpiece worthy of divine artistry.</p>
<p>They can also glory in their infirmities, smile through their tears, and sing in the midst of their sorrow, because they realize that in God&#8217;s economy, &#8220;If we suffer, we shall also reign with Him.&#8221;</p>
