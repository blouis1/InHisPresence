<h1>The Wisdom of God</h1>

<aside>Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.<br />&mdash;Psalm 37:5</aside><p>To know the will of God is the highest of all wisdom. Living in the center of God&#8217;s will rules out all falseness of religion and puts the stamp of true sincerity upon our service to God. You can be miserable with much, if you are out of His will; but you can have peace in your heart with little, if you are in the will of God. You can be wretched with wealth and fame, out of His will; but you can have joy in obscurity, if you are in the will of God. You can have agony in good health, out of His will; but you can be happy in the midst of suffering, if you are in God&#8217;s will. You can be miserable and defeated in the midst of acclaim, if you are out of His will; but you can be calm and at peace in the midst of persecution, as long as you are in the will of God. The Bible reveals that God has a plan for every life, and that if we live in constant fellowship with Him, He will direct and lead us in the fulfillment of this plan.</p>
