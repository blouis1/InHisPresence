<h1>Satisfaction of Soul</h1>

<aside>Thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the Lord thy God hath given unto thee . . . <br />&mdash;Deuteronomy 26:11</aside><p>Often the Church has banged away negatively at evils without reminding us that God is tremendously interested in our finding a satisfying way of life here and now. We Christians have talked so much of the negative side of Christian experience that we have forgotten to emphasize the positive, joyous, thrilling, and victorious experience of daily fellowship with Christ. God declared that things will not satisfy. God satisfies! This is the secret of soul-satisfaction: Let your soul delight itself in fatness. Remove the obstructions, tear down the barriers, and let your soul find the fulfillment of its deepest longings in fellowship with God.</p>
