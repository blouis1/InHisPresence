<h1>Released From Selfishness</h1>

<aside>He must increase, but I must decrease.<br />&mdash;John 3:30</aside><p>Self-centeredness is the basic cause of much of our distress in life. Hypochondria, a mental disorder which is accompanied by melancholy and depression, is often caused by self-pity and self-centeredness. Most of us suffer from spiritual nearsightedness. Our interests, our loves, and our energies are too often focused upon ourselves. Jesus underscored the fact that His disciples were to live outflowingly rather than selfishly. To the rich young ruler He said, &#8220;If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven&#8221; (Matthew 19:21). It wasn&#8217;t the giving away of his goods that Jesus demanded, particularly, but that he be released from selfishness, and its devastating effect on his personality and life.</p>
