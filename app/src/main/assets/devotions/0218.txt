<h1>How Will You Live?</h1>

<aside>And Jesus said, . . . and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.<br />&mdash;Mark 14:62</aside><p>The world in which we live is full of pessimism. No Christian has the scriptural right to go around wringing his hands wondering what we are to do in the face of the present world situation. The Scripture says that in the midst of persecution, confusion, wars, and rumors of wars, we are to comfort one another with the knowledge that our Lord Jesus Christ is coming back in triumph, glory, and majesty. Many times when I go to bed at night I think to myself that before I awaken Christ may come. Sometimes when I get up and look at the dawn I think that perhaps this is the day He will come. He has told us Christians to be watching constantly and to be ready, &#8220;for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh&#8221; (Matthew 24:44). Do you think Christ will come today? &#8220;Probably not,&#8221; you say. It is on just such a day that He may come. What a glorious time of reunion it&#8217;s going to be, when we shall be caught up with Him!</p>
