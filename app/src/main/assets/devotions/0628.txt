<h1>Refiner’s Fire</h1>

<aside>And when he was in affliction, he besought the Lord his God, and humbled himself . . . <br />&mdash;2 Chronicles 33:12</aside><p>Why do Christians suffer? Rest assured that there is a reason for Christian people being afflicted. One reason why God&#8217;s people suffer, according to the Bible, is that it is a disciplinary, chastening, and molding process. From the Scriptures we learn that the chastening of affliction is a step in the process of our full and complete development. Affliction can also be a means of refining and of purification. Many a life has come forth from the furnace of affliction more beautiful and more useful than before.</p>
