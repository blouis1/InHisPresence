<h1>A Thousand Anxieties</h1>

<aside>I sought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.<br />&mdash;Psalm 34:4</aside><p>Man has always been beset by worry, and the pressures of modern life have aggravated the problem. To men of all time Jesus said, &#8220;Take therefore no thought for the morrow . . . but seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you&#8221; (Matthew 6:33-34). Many of you are filled with a thousand anxieties. Bring them to Jesus Christ by faith. He will bring peace to your soul and your mind.</p>
