    <h1>Gentle With All  - File 2</h1>
	<p>
		Love and laugh. <br></br>
	
		Make your world the happier for your being in it. Love and rejoice on the gray days. <br></br>
	   
		There are wilderness days for My Disciples as well as Mountains of Transfiguration, but on both it is duty, persistently, faithfully done, that tells. <br></br>

		Be gentle with all. Try to see the heart I see, to know the pain and difficulty of the other life, that I know. Try, before you interview anyone, or speak to anyone, to ask Me to act as interpreter between you two.

		<br></br>Just live the spirit of prayer. In speaking to Me, you find soul-rest. Simple tasks, faithfully done and persisted in, bring their own reward, and are mosaics being laid in the pavement of success.

		<br></br> Welcome all who come here. I love you.
