<h1>Wisdom to Understand</h1>

<aside>Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest.<br />&mdash;Genesis 28:15</aside><p>When Jesus uttered His words of comfort in the first few verses of the fourteenth chapter of John&#8217;s Gospel, concluding with, &#8220;And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know&#8221; (John 14:4), Thomas said unto Him, &#8220;Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?&#8221; (John 14:5). Jesus answered him with a statement which has in it the ring of eternity. It was sublimely simple and yet profoundly deep. Its surface meaning was clear to all, and yet the great theologians have never completely sounded its mighty depths. This is that statement, &#8220;I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Father, but by me&#8221; (John 14:6).</p>
<p>In one majestic sweep, these words silenced Thomas&#8217; questioning tongue and brought reassurance and peace to the hearts of the other disciples. Within the marvel of that authoritative sentence from the lips of the Son of God, there was enough comfort to assuage the sufferings of the tormented, enough wisdom to satisfy those who yearned for understanding, and enough power to set the great Christian movement in motion.</p>
