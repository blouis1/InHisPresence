<h1>Eyes to See</h1>

<aside>To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light . . . <br />&mdash;Acts 26:18</aside><p>The blind man, Bartimaeus, threw off his cloak and ran trembling to Jesus. And Jesus said, &#8220;What do you want me to do for you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Lord, that I may receive my sight.&#8221; In that moment as he said, &#8220;Lord,&#8221; his spiritual eyes were opened. And Jesus said, &#8220;Your faith has made you whole.&#8221; Notice-not your intellectual understanding, not your money, not your works-but your faith. Faith! That&#8217;s all it takes! Immediately Bartimaeus, who had been blind all of his life, began to open his eyes, and the first thing he saw was the face of Jesus. What an experience-to open one&#8217;s eyes and look straight into the strong, tender face of Jesus! Bartimaeus met Jesus and the record says he &#8220;followed Jesus in the way.&#8221; When you go back to your business, or your home, or your neighborhood, or your friends, or your school, you don&#8217;t go alone. Christ goes with you.</p>
