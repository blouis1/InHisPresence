<h1>He Died For Us</h1>

<aside>But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.<br />&mdash;Romans 5:8</aside><p>As we stand at the cross of Christ we see a glorious exhibition of God&#8217;s love. Paul wrote to the Christians in Rome, &#8220;While we were powerless to help ourselves . . . Christ died for sinful men.&#8221; In human experience, it is a rare thing for one man to give his life for another, even if the latter be a good man, though there have been a few who have had the courage to do it. Yet the proof of God&#8217;s amazing love is this: that it was &#8220;while we were sinners Christ died for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>A beautiful young society leader came to visit my wife and me. She had been converted to Christ in one of our Crusades, and she was absolutely radiant in her transformation. Already she had learned scores of Scripture verses by heart and was so full of Christ that we sat for two hours listening to her give her moving testimony. Over and over she said, &#8220;I cannot understand how God could  forgive me. I have been such a wicked sinner. I just cannot understand the love of God.&#8221;</p>
