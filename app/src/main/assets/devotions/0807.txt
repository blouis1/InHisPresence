<h1>The Mind of Christ</h1>

<aside>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.<br />&mdash;2 Timothy 1:7</aside><p>Many diseases of both body and mind are self-inflicted. For example, ulcers are often caused by worry and anxiety. Heart attacks are caused many times by overexertion. Unjustified worry, fear, prejudice, hatred, and envy can contribute to mental stress, which could lead to mental illness. So one way to have a healthy mind is to avoid those practices. But the Bible-way to a healthy mind is this, &#8220;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.&#8221; If you have the mind of Christ, worry will be offset by trust, enmity by love, and fear by faith.</p>
