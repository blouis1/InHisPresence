<h1>The Importance of Corporate Worship</h1>

<aside>Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together . . . <br />&mdash;Hebrews 10:25</aside><p>I will not argue with you about nature inspiring thoughts of God. David said, &#8220;The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handiwork.&#8221; But at the same time, I would give you no comfort about absenting yourself from the house of God. The Bible says, &#8220;Christ loved the Church and gave Himself for it.&#8221; If our Lord loved it enough to die for it, then we should respect it enough to support and attend it. I like what Theodore Roosevelt once said, &#8220;You may worship God anywhere, at any time, but the chances are that you will not do so unless you have first learned to worship Him somewhere in some particular place, at some particular time.&#8221;</p>
