<h1>Lean on the Rock</h1>

<aside>When my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.<br />&mdash;Psalm 61:2</aside><p>When you become a Christian, it doesn&#8217;t mean that you will live on a perpetual &#8220;high.&#8221; The Psalmist David went down to the very depths, and so did the Apostle Paul. But in the midst of all circumstances God&#8217;s grace, peace, and joy are there. The tears will still come, the pressures will be felt, and so will the temptations. But there is a new dimension, a new direction, and a new power in life to face the circumstances in which you live.</p>
