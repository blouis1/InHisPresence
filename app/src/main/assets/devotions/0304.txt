<h1>Jesus is Coming</h1>

<aside>But don't forget this, dear friends. . . . He isn't really being slow about his promised return, even though it sometimes seems that way. But he is waiting, for the good reason that he is not willing that any should perish, and he is giving more time for sinners to repent.<br />&mdash;2 Peter 3:8,9 (TLB)</aside><p>Many people are asking, &#8220;Where is history heading?&#8221; A careful student of the Bible will be led to see that God controls the clock of destiny. Amid the world&#8217;s confusion, God&#8217;s omnipotent hand moves, working out His unchanging plan and purpose. Jesus Christ is coming to earth again. It is Christ who is in control, and He will determine the outcome. George Whitefield, the great English evangelist, said, &#8220;I am daily waiting for the coming of the Son of God.&#8221; But he did not sit down and do nothing. He burned out his life in proclaiming the Gospel of Christ.</p>
