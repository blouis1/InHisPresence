<h1>The Life of a Servant</h1>

<aside>So he went and did according unto the word of the Lord . . . <br />&mdash;1 Kings 17:5</aside><p>As messengers of God, we will often lead lonely lives. &#8220;All men forsook me,&#8221; said Paul. It is a price we have to pay; there is a loneliness in the Gospel. Yet you will not be alone, because you will be ministered to by the Spirit of God, as Elijah was ministered to at the brook Cherith. A true messenger lives a burdened life. If he is the Lord&#8217;s vessel, he carries in his heart a burden for souls none can share but those who know it firsthand.</p>
