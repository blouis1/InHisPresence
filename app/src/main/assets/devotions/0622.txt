<h1>The Most Unique Person</h1>

<aside>Worthy is the Lamb . . . to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.<br />&mdash;Revelation 5:12</aside><p>H.G. Wells wrote, &#8220;Christ is the most unique person of history. No man can write a history of the human race without giving first and foremost place to the penniless teacher of Nazareth.&#8221; Rabbi Stephen Wise said concerning Jesus, &#8220;You will find that He is divinely human. It is no mean joy to us of the house of Israel to recognize, to honor and to cherish among our brethren, Jesus the Jew, who has influenced the world more than any other man.&#8221; This person called Jesus lived on earth for only 33 years. He never traveled more than 100 miles from His home. Yet Charles Lamb was right in saying, &#8220;If all the illustrious men of history were gathered together and Shakespeare should enter their presence, they would rise to do him honor; but if Jesus Christ should come in, they would fall down and worship Him.&#8221;</p>
