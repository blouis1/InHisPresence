<h1>Where Is Heaven?</h1>

<aside>I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me.<br />&mdash;Luke 22:29</aside><p>Many people have asked, &#8220;Where is heaven?&#8221; We are not told in the Scripture where heaven is. Some students have tried to take some Scriptures and put them together and say that heaven is in the north. They quote Psalm 48:2, &#8220;The joy of the whole earth is . . . on the sides of the north . . . &#8221; The magnetic needle points north. Perhaps the Celestial City is in the north. We do not know. But no matter where heaven is, it will be where Christ is. </p>
<p>Many people ask, &#8220;Do you believe that heaven is a literal place?&#8221; Yes! Jesus said, &#8220;I go to prepare a place for you.&#8221; The Bible teaches that Enoch and Elijah ascended in a literal body to a literal place that is just as real as Los Angeles, London, or Algiers! The Bible also teaches that heaven will be a place of beauty. It is described in the Bible as &#8220;a building of God&#8221;-&#8220;a city&#8221;-&#8220;a better country&#8221;-&#8220;an inheritance&#8221;-&#8220;a glory.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Bible also indicates that heaven will be a place of great understanding and knowledge of things that we never learned down here.</p>
