<h1>The Problem of Boredom</h1>

<aside>. . . knowing what lies ahead for you, you won't become bored with being a Christian . . . <br />&mdash;Hebrews 6:12 (TLB)</aside><p>Do you know what nearly all the sociologists say today in their study of young people? The greatest problem facing young people today is not sex—it is boredom. Did you know that when they had the riot at Hampton Beach in New Hampshire they asked the young people what was wrong, why did they do it? Many of them said, &#8220;Just for the hell of it.&#8221; Bored—life has no purpose, life has no meaning. Give your life to Christ and you will never spend another bored minute.</p>
