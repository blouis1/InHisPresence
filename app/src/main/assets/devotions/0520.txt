<h1>Complete Victory</h1>

<aside>. . . greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.<br />&mdash;1 John 4:4</aside><p>Paul once wrote, &#8220;For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other; so that ye can not do the things that ye would&#8221; (Galatians 5:17). This is the battle or the tension that is present in us to a greater or lesser degree. So, you see, the spiritual lag that you feel is explained in the Bible. That does not mean that you accept it as the way it should be. You should make all necessary preparations for this battle which the Bible says &#8220;is not against flesh and blood, but against spiritual forces.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Ephesians 6 we read that the Bible tells what preparation you should make. In the meantime, always remember that &#8220;where sin abounds, grace did much more abound.&#8221; You can have complete victory! We are told to submit ourselves unto God, and the devil will flee from us. We are also promised that &#8220;sin shall not reign over us.&#8221;</p>
