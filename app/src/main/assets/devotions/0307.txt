<h1>The Divine Standard</h1>

<aside>For salvation that comes from trusting Christ . . . is already within easy reach of each of us . . . <br />&mdash;Romans 10:8 (TLB)</aside><p>Christ said there is a happiness in that acknowledgment of spiritual poverty which lets God come into our souls. Now, the Bible teaches that our souls have a disease. It causes all the troubles and difficulties in the world. It causes all the troubles, confusions, and disillusionments in your own life. The name of the disease is an ugly word. We don&#8217;t like to use it. It is &#8220;sin.&#8221; All of us have pride. We do not like to confess that we are wrong or that we have failed. But God says, &#8220;All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.&#8221; We have failed to live up to the divine standard. We must confess our sin as the first step to happiness, peace, and contentment.</p>
