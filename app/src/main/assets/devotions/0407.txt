<h1>What Makes Christianity Different?</h1>

<aside>He is not here, but is risen.<br />&mdash;Luke 24:6</aside><p>Something distinguishes Christianity from all the religions of the world. Not only does it carry the truth of the redemption, by the death of our Savior for our sins on the cross, but it carries the fact that Christ rose again. Only the Christian faith claims that its Leader died and rose again and is alive at this moment. Many gravestones carry the inscription, &#8220;Here lies . . . ,&#8221; but on Christ&#8217;s tomb are emblazoned the words, &#8220;He is not here.&#8221; Christianity has no shrines to visit, no dusty remains to venerate, no tombs at which to worship. Many good men have lived, and still live, in the memory of those who knew them, but there is only one Man who conquered death-Jesus Christ-and He will live forever.</p>
