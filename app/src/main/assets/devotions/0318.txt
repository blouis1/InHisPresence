<h1>Tame Your Temper</h1>

<aside>Doest thou well to be angry?<br />&mdash;Jonah 4:4</aside><p>You have a temper! There is nothing unique about that. Most people have tempers, in varying degrees, of course. God does not ask that you get rid of that temper. But He does say that if you are to be happy, it must be brought under control and rechanneled to proper use. God cannot use a man without a temper as well as one with a controlled temper. Too many professed Christians never get &#8220;wrought up&#8221; about anything; they never get indignant with injustice, with corruption in high places, or with the godless traffics which barter away the souls and bodies of men.</p>
