<h1>Christ is Our Comforter</h1>

<aside>. . . realize that your heavenly Father will . . . give the Holy Spirit to those who ask for him.<br />&mdash;Luke 11:13 (TLB)</aside><p>Before He left His disciples, Christ promised that He would send a Comforter to help them in the trials, cares, and temptations of life. This word comforter means &#8220;one that helps alongside.&#8221; He is the Holy Spirit, the powerful Third Person of the Trinity. The moment you are born again, He takes up residence in your heart. You may not emotionally feel Him there, but you must exercise faith. Believe it! Accept it as a fact of faith! He is in your heart to help you. We are told that He sheds the love of God abroad in our hearts. He produces the fruit of the Spirit: &#8220;love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.&#8221; We cannot possibly manufacture this fruit in our own strength. It is supernaturally manufactured by the Holy Spirit who lives in our hearts!</p>
