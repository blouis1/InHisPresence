<h1>Respect for Authority</h1>

<aside>And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All [authority] is given unto me in heaven and in earth.<br />&mdash;Matthew 28:18</aside><p>Have respect for authority. Jesus Christ was under the authority of His Father in heaven . . . He lived for one thing: to fulfill the will of the Father. Everyone is subject to some kind of authority. There is one chain of command and the ultimate authority at the top is God.</p>
<p>What is the authority in your life? Is it your selfishness? Your lust? Your greed? Or have you turned it all over to God and said, &#8220;Lord, You are going to be my authority?&#8221; When you are under authority, you are then able to assume authority.</p>
