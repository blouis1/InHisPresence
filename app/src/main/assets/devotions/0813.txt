<h1>Life-Changing Power</h1>

<aside>Christ died and rose again . . . so that he can be our Lord both while we live and when we die.<br />&mdash;Romans 14:9 (TLB)</aside><p>With a frequency that is amazing, the Bible affirms the fact of the bodily resurrection of Christ. Perhaps the most direct of all its statements is Luke&#8217;s account in the book of Acts, where he reports, &#8220;To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days&#8221; (Acts 1:3). What are we going to do with these &#8220;many infallible proofs&#8221;? Someone asked my colleague George Beverly Shea how much he knew about God. He said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know much, but what I do know has changed my life.&#8221; We may not be able to take all of this evidence into a scientific laboratory and prove it; but, if we accept any fact of history, we must accept the fact that Jesus Christ rose from the dead.</p>
