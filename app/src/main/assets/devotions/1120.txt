<h1>Stumbling in Darkness</h1>

<aside>The one who is the true Light arrived to shine on everyone coming into the world.<br />&mdash;John 1:9 (TLB)</aside><p>The world is stumbling in darkness from one crisis to another. The crises are getting worse and worse, and are coming closer and closer to home. Inflation, population explosion, hunger, dominate vast areas of the world. Jesus said, &#8220;I am the light of the world. You follow me and give your life to me and I&#8217;ll take you out of the darkness of this world, out of this confusion, out of this mess that you&#8217;re in, and I&#8217;ll give you peace and joy. A light will burn in your heart and mind that you never had before. I will command the light to come on in your life.&#8221;</p>
