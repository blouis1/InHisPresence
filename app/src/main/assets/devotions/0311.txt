<h1>The Power of Speech</h1>

<aside>Submit yourselves therefore to God . . . <br />&mdash;James 4:7</aside><p>You have a tongue and a voice. These instruments of speech can be used destructively or employed constructively. You can use your tongue to slander, to gripe, to scold, to nag, and to quarrel; or you can bring it under the control of God&#8217;s Spirit and make it an instrument of blessing and praise. The 20th-century version of James 3:3 says, &#8220;When we put bits into the horses&#8217; mouths to make them obey us, we control the rest of their bodies also.&#8221; Just so, when we submit to the claims of Christ upon our lives, our untamed natures are brought under His control. We become meek, tamed, and &#8220;fit for the Master&#8217;s service.&#8221;</p>
