<h1>What Heaven Will Be Like</h1>

<aside>And there shall be no more curse; but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him.<br />&mdash;Revelation 22:3</aside><p>The Bible indicates that heaven will be a place of great understanding and knowledge of things that we never learned down here. Sir Isaac Newton, when an old man, said to one who praised his wisdom, &#8220;I am as a child on the seashore picking up a pebble here and a shell there, but the great ocean of truth still lies before me.&#8221; And Thomas Edison once said, &#8220;I do not know one millionth part of one percent about anything.&#8221; Many of the mysteries of God-the heartaches, trials, disappointments, tragedies, and the silence of God in the midst of suffering-will be revealed in heaven.</p>
