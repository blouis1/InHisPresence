<h1>Christianity is Serious</h1>

<aside>Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only . . . <br />&mdash;James 1:22</aside><p>Jesus indicated that there will be a permissive society just before He comes back. &#8220;As in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the coming of the Son of man.&#8221; The world today is on an immoral binge that has not been known since the days of Rome. We are in a hedonistic society, and what we are seeing is human nature expressing itself without God.</p>
<p>Many have fallen into an antinomianism in which they believe intellectually and then go out and live like the devil, imagining that God will forgive them and take them to heaven. I believe there is an obedience to the Gospel, there is a self-denial and a bearing of the cross, if you are to be a follower of Christ. Being a Christian is serious business.</p>
