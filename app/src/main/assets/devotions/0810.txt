<h1>A New World</h1>

<aside>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for<BR>them that love him.<br />&mdash;1 Corinthians 2:9</aside><p>At the close of the Bible we encounter these words, &#8220;And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away.&#8221; A new world is coming! Each time we pray in the Lord&#8217;s Prayer, &#8220;Thy kingdom come,&#8221; we should remember that that prayer will be answered. Heaven is described as a new creation in which we shall move in new bodies, possessed of new names, singing new songs, living in a new city, by a new form of government, and challenged by new prospects of eternity with social justice for all. The paradise that man lost will be regained, but it will be much more. It will not be the old one repaired, patched up, and made over. When God says, &#8220;Behold, I make all things new,&#8221; the emphasis is on all things. One day we shall live in a brand-new world. Centuries ago the apostles greeted each other with the word, &#8220;Maranatha&#8221;-the Lord is coming.</p>
