<h1>Die to Yourself</h1>

<aside>The Lord is close to those whose hearts are breaking; he rescues those who are humbly sorry for their sins.<br />&mdash;Psalm 34:18 (TLB)</aside><p>In God&#8217;s economy, you must go down into the valley of grief before you can scale the heights of spiritual glory. You must become tired and weary of living alone before you seek and find the fellowship of Christ. You must come to the end of self before you begin to live. The mourning of inadequacy is a weeping that catches the attention of God. The Bible says, &#8220;The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.&#8221; The happiest day of my life was when I realized that my own ability, my own goodness, and my own morality was insufficient in the sight of God; and I publicly and openly acknowledged my need of Christ. I am not exaggerating when I say that my mourning was turned to joy, and my sighing into singing.</p>
