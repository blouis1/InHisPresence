<h1>Reconciliation</h1>

<aside>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son . . . <br />&mdash;Romans 5:10</aside><p>The word &#8220;reconcile&#8221; means literally &#8220;bring into a changed relationship.&#8221; It means to bring together two parties who should have been together all along. The Bible speaks of the human race as enemies of God. You may say that you are no &#8220;enemy&#8221; of God, but according to Scripture we are either passive or active enemies of God, apart from Christ. Reconciliation means &#8220;brought back into full relationship and fellowship with God.&#8221; This is what Christ accomplished on the cross. What a thrilling thought!</p>
