<h1>Believe in the Holy Spirit</h1>

<aside>. . . I [have] raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee . . . <br />&mdash;Romans 9:17</aside><p>Walter Knight tells the story about a little boy who had recently received Christ. &#8220;Daddy, how can I believe in the Holy Spirit when I have never seen Him?&#8221; asked Jim. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show you how,&#8221; said his father, who was an electrician. Later Jim went with his father to the power plant where he was shown the generators. &#8220;This is where the power comes from to heat our stove and to give us light. We cannot see the power, but it is in that machine and in the power lines,&#8221; said the father. &#8220;I believe in electricity,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;Of course you do,&#8221; said his father, &#8220;but you don&#8217;t believe in it because you see it. You believe in it because you see what it can do. Likewise, you can believe in the Holy Spirit because you can see what He does in people&#8217;s lives when they are surrendered to Christ and possess His power.&#8221;</p>
