<h1>The Finished Work</h1>

<aside>Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.<br />&mdash;John 3:3</aside><p>A person is saved by trusting in the finished work of Christ on the cross, and not by bodily sensations and religious ecstasy. But you will say, &#8220;What about feeling? Is there no place in saving faith for feeling?&#8221; Certainly, there is room for feeling in saving faith. But we are not saved by it. Whatever feeling there may be is the result of saving faith, but feeling never saved a single soul. Love is feeling. Joy is feeling. Inward peace is feeling. Love for others is a feeling. Concern for the lost is a feeling. But these feelings are not conversion. The one experience that you can look for and expect is the experience of believing in Christ.</p>
