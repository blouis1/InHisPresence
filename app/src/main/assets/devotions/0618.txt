<h1>Comfort in Mourning</h1>

<aside>What a wonderful God we have . . . who so wonderfully comforts and strengthens us . . . <br />&mdash;2 Corinthians 1:3,4 (TLB)</aside><p>The Bible teaches unmistakably that we can triumph over bereavement. The Psalmist said, &#8220;Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.&#8221; Self-pity can bring no enduring comfort. The fact is, it will only add to your misery. And unremitting grief will give you little consolation in itself, for grief begets grief. Sorrow, or mourning, when it is borne in a Christian way, contains a built-in comfort. &#8220;Happy are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted.&#8221; There is comfort in mourning, because we know that Christ is with us. He has said, &#8220;Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.&#8221; Suffering is endurable if we do not have to bear it alone; and the more compassionate the Presence, the less acute the pain.</p>
