<h1>Where is Your Hope?</h1>

<aside>This certain hope of being saved is a strong and trustworthy anchor for our souls, connecting us with God himself . . . <br />&mdash;Hebrews 6:19 (TLB)</aside><p>What are you placing your hope in for the future? Your country&#8217;s government, educational system, some plan or organization? My hope is in a Person, the Lord Jesus Christ, who sits at the right hand of God. I have hope and know that I&#8217;m going to heaven. And, right here and now in this present life, I have God&#8217;s presence to help me.</p>
<p>Suppose we had no Bible. Suppose there were no cross, no salvation, no empty tomb. Suppose we had nothing to hang on except, &#8220;Do your best, try to patch it up, do what you can.&#8221; Oh, but we have a hope. There is a plan of redemption, a plan for the future. The New Testament is an exciting Book to read, it is so full of hope and expectancy. And God is interested in you!</p>
