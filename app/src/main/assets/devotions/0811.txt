<h1>God’s Unmerited Favor</h1>

<aside>For by grace are ye saved . . . <br />&mdash;Ephesians 2:8</aside><p>&#8220;Grace,&#8221; according to the dictionary, is the unmerited favor of God toward mankind. The word &#8220;grace&#8221; is used over 170 times in the New Testament alone. Grace is not bought. It is a free gift of almighty God to needy mankind. When I picture Jesus Christ dying on the cross, I see the free gift of God&#8217;s grace in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself. I sing with the songwriter, &#8220;Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now am found, was blind, but now I see.&#8221; Your human mind, with its philosophy of an equal return for favors done, can hardly comprehend the full meaning of this grace of God. But when you catch, by the inspiration of God, its full meaning, you will leave the limits of human reasoning and revel in the spiritual riches of divine truth and privilege.</p>
<p>Yes, the grace of God is a reality. Thousands have tried, tested, and proved that it is more than a cold creed, a docile doctrine, or a tedious theory. The grace of God has been tested in the crucible of human experience, and has been found to be more than an equal for the problems and sins of humanity.</p>
