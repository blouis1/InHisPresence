<h1>The Beginning of Jesus</h1>

<aside>Before Abraham was, I am.<br />&mdash;John 8:58</aside><p>Jesus did not begin in Bethlehem. The Bible says, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221; Jesus said that He existed before the foundation of the world. He was there when the moon and stars were flung out into space from the Father&#8217;s flaming fingertips. He was there when God created this planet. He has always existed. He is &#8220;from everlasting to everlasting.&#8221;</p>
