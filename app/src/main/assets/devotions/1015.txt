<h1>Experience Jesus</h1>

<aside>The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.<br />&mdash;John 6:63</aside><p>To one of the most religious men of His day, Jesus said, &#8220;Ye must be born again&#8221; (John 3:7). Nicodemus could not substitute his profound knowledge of religion for spiritual rebirth, and neither can we. I have read a book on water skiing, and it did not take long for me to learn that I could never learn to water ski by reading a book-I would have to experience it. </p>
<p>I have read a number of books on golf, but none of them seems to improve my game; I must get out on the golf course and play. You may study theology and religion, but there comes a time when you must experience Christ for yourself.</p>
