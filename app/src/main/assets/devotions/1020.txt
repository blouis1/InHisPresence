<h1>Victory Over Temptation</h1>

<aside>. . . tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope; and hope maketh not ashamed . . . <br />&mdash;Romans 5:3–5</aside><p>God never promised to remove temptation from us, for even Christ was subject to it. The Bible says that &#8220;He was tested in all things, like as we, yet without sin.&#8221; There is no good reason why you should seek to escape, for such times of testing have beneficial effects. There is a sense of achievement and assurance that results from victory over temptation that cannot come to us otherwise. </p>
<p>Temptation shows what people really are. It does not make us Christian or un-Christian. It does make the Christian stronger and causes him to discover resources of power. You can benefit from what might be tragedy, if you will only discover that in just such a time of temptation, Christ can become more real to you than ever, and His salvation will become more meaningful.</p>
