<h1>Seeing Our Need</h1>

<aside>Only a fool would say to himself, ‘There is no God.' And why does he say it? Because of his wicked heart, his dark and evil deeds. His life is corroded with sin.<br />&mdash;Psalm 53:1 (TLB)</aside><p>We live like a little ant on this little speck of dust out in space. We get a Ph.D. degree and we strut across the stage and say, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know whether or not there is a God.&#8221; And we can&#8217;t even control ourselves. We can&#8217;t even keep from blowing ourselves apart. We can&#8217;t even keep from manufacturing nuclear weapons that could destroy the world. We can&#8217;t even keep from hating each other, and fighting with each other, and killing each other. We can&#8217;t even keep from stealing from each other. We can&#8217;t even keep from dying, because all of us are going to die. No wonder the Bible says, &#8220;The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God,&#8221; because a man that would deny the existence of God is a fool.</p>
