<h1>Pure Hearts</h1>

<aside>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.<br />&mdash;Philippians 2:5</aside><p>It is impossible to live pure lives until we have pure hearts. Many people today are trying to put the cart before the horse. They are teaching purity of motives, desires, and actions to old, deceitful hearts! No wonder we have ended up such moral failures, in spite of our vaunted knowledge and psychological approaches.</p>
<p>Pure motives, desires, and actions stem from pure hearts. Pure hearts will be Christlike. It is God&#8217;s desire that we be conformed to the image of His Son. If Christ lives within us and our bodies become the abode of the Holy Spirit, is it any wonder that we should be like Him?</p>
