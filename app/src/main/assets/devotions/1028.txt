<h1>Genuine Love</h1>

<aside> . . . being knit together in love . . . <br />&mdash;Colossians 2:2</aside><p>Thousands of young couples go through with a loveless marriage because no one ever told them what genuine love is. I believe we need to read the 13th chapter of First Corinthians, in which the Apostle Paul gives us a definition of love. He says, &#8220;Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful; it is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends.&#8221; If people today knew that kind of love, the divorce rate would be sharply reduced.</p>
