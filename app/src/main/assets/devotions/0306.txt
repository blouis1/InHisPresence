<h1>A Heart of Belief</h1>

<aside>If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.<br />&mdash;Romans 10:9</aside><p>The heart is the blood-pump of the body. It is also used metaphorically when we speak of affections and feelings. Since it is the central organ of the body and one of the most vital, the Bible speaks of it as the wellspring of life. Hence, it is used synonymously with &#8220;life.&#8221; When the Bible says, &#8220;Son, give me thine heart,&#8221; it doesn&#8217;t mean that we are to cut out our actual hearts and give them to God. It means that we are to give Him our lives, our all. When we come to Christ, we are not only to give intellectual assent with our minds, we are to &#8220;believe in our hearts.&#8221; We can believe in the historic Jesus, but if we have &#8220;saving faith&#8221; our belief must involve our whole being. When we believe with all our hearts, the will, the emotions, and the intellect are surrendered to Christ.</p>
