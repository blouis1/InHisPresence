<h1>The Hands of Jesus</h1>

<aside>. . . I was hungry, [and] you gave me food . . . <br />&mdash;Matthew 25:35 (NEB)</aside><p>During the war a church in Strasburg, Germany, was totally destroyed; but a statue of Christ which stood by the altar was almost unharmed. Only the hands of the statue were missing. When the church was rebuilt, a famous sculptor offered to make new hands; but, after considering the matter, the members decided to let it stand as it was—without hands. &#8220;For,&#8221; they said, &#8220;Christ has no hands but our hands to do His work on earth. If we don&#8217;t feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, entertain the stranger, visit the imprisoned, and clothe the naked, who will?&#8221; Christ is depending on us to do the very things which He did while upon earth. My friend, if the gospel we preach does not have a social application, if it will not work effectively in the work-a-day world, then it is not the Gospel of Christ.</p>
