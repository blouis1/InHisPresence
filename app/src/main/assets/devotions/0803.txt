<h1>Sufficient to Save</h1>

<aside>There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.<br />&mdash;Proverbs 14:12</aside><p>A line of human thought that seems right to many people is the idea of self-redemption. Man thinks he must work at righteousness to save himself. After all, it was man who sinned and as we say, &#8220;God helps those who help themselves.&#8221; But a greater truth than this emerges from the Bible-the truth that God helps those who cannot help themselves. We cannot save ourselves. It is noble to be upright if we can. It is admirable to be honest, kind, and compassionate. It would seem that these characteristics would be sufficient to save our souls. But the Bible says that though this way seems right, it is wrong.</p>
