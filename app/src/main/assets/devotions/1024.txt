<h1>Prejudice Is Weakness</h1>

<aside>Judge not, that ye be not judged.<br />&mdash;Matthew 7:1</aside><p>The word prejudice means &#8220;prejudging&#8221; or &#8220;making an estimate of others without knowing the facts.&#8221; Prejudice is a mark of weakness, not of strength. Prejudice is measured by computing the distance between our own biased opinions and the real truth. If we would all be perfectly honest before God, there would be no prejudice.</p>
