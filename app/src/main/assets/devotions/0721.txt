<h1>Talk vs. Action</h1>

<aside>Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter<BR>into the kingdom of heaven.<br />&mdash;Matthew 5:20</aside><p>In a decadent society the will to believe, to resist, to contend, to fight, to struggle, is gone. In place of this will to resist, there is the desire to conform, to drift, to follow, to yield, and to give up. This is what happened in Rome, but it also applies to us. The same conditions that prevailed in Rome prevail in our society. Before Rome fell, her standards were abandoned, the family disintegrated, divorce prevailed, immorality was rampant, and faith was at a low ebb. As Gibbon said, &#8220;There was much talk of religion, but few practiced it.&#8221;</p>
