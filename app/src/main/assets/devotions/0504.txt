<h1>Everlasting Peace</h1>

<aside>But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace . . . <br />&mdash;Ephesians 2:13,14</aside><p>Meaningless mouthings about peace will not bring it to the world. In Glasgow, Scotland, we watched the Communists march around St. George&#8217;s Square carrying their banners with the words, &#8220;Our motto is PEACE!&#8221; My thoughts raced back to Korea, where I had seen the havoc and suffering caused by these people who now use &#8220;peace&#8221; as their motto. Peace is more than five little white letters painted on a piece of red cloth, carried by a goose-stepping zealot in a Red parade. It is not a mere cessation of hostilities, a momentary halt in a hot or cold war. Rather, it is something positive. It is a specific relationship with God into which a person is brought. It is a spiritual reality in a human heart which has come into vital contact with the infinite God.</p>
