<h1>God Our Comforter</h1>

<aside>I, even I, am he that comforteth you . . . <br />&mdash;Isaiah 51:12</aside><p>There is also comfort in mourning, because in the midst of mourning God gives a song. His presence in our lives changes our mourning into song, and that song is a song of comfort. This kind of comfort is the kind which enabled a devout Englishman to look at a deep dark hole in the ground where his home stood before the bombing and say, &#8220;I always did want a basement. Now I can jolly well build another house, like I always wanted.&#8221; This kind of comfort is the kind which enabled a young minister&#8217;s wife in a church near us to teach her Sunday school class of girls on the very day of her husband&#8217;s funeral. Her mourning was not the kind which had no hope-it was a mourning of faith in the goodness and wisdom of God; it believed that our heavenly Father makes no mistakes.</p>
