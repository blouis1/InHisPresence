<h1>Our Greatest Need</h1>

<aside>God did not send his Son into the world to condemn it, but to save it.<br />&mdash;John 3:17 (TLB)</aside><p>You can put a public school and university in the middle of every block of every city in America—but you will never keep America from rotting morally by mere intellectual education. Education cannot be properly called education which neglects the most important parts of man&#8217;s nature. Partial education throughout the world is far worse than none at all if we educate the mind but not the soul. To think of civilizing men without converting them to Christ is about as wise as to think about transforming wolves into lambs merely by washing them and putting on them a fleece of wool. &#8220;Happy are the merciful; for they shall obtain mercy.&#8221; The mercy the world needs is the grace, love, and peace of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is His transforming and regenerating power that the world needs more than anything else.</p>
