<h1>Battle of the Spirit</h1>

<aside>Let the peace of God rule in your hearts . . . <br />&mdash;Colossians 3:15</aside><p>When we examine the problems that confront us in our world today, we find that every one of them resolves into a problem of &#8220;inner space,&#8221; a problem of the dark side of the human spirit. From thousands of letters we receive, it is evident that a large proportion of the population is facing deep personal problems. They vary from person to person, but they do exist, and they are all problems of &#8220;inner space.&#8221; </p>
<p>Yes, we are the people who have been conquering outer space, but are in danger of losing the battle of the spirit. But there is a solution-for millions it has already been reached-and that solution is in Jesus Christ. He said, &#8220;My peace&#8221;-my liberty, my freedom-&#8220;I give unto you&#8221; (John 14:27). </p>
<p>Today if we will turn the searchlight of truth on the dark side of our human spirits and let Jesus Christ become the Master Control of our lives, a new day will dawn for us. Submit the &#8220;inner space&#8221; of your life to Him.</p>
