<h1>The Ultimate Peace</h1>

<aside>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you . . . <br />&mdash;John 14:27</aside><p>Jesus said, &#8220;Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.&#8221; Where does peacemaking begin? How can we become peacemakers? Can peace be discovered within ourselves? Freud has told us that peace is but a mental attitude. Cast off our phobias, shed our neuroses, and &#8220;bingo!&#8221;-we&#8217;ll have the coveted peace we long for. I respect psychiatry for what it can do. Unquestionably, it has helped many. But it certainly is not satisfactory as a substitute for the peace which can come only from God. If psychiatry leaves God out, ultimately we shall see psychiatrists going to each other for treatment. There can be no peace until we find peace with God. The Bible says, &#8220;He is our peace.&#8221;</p>
