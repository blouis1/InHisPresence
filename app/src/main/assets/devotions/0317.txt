<h1>Sight for the Blind</h1>

<aside>. . . one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.<br />&mdash;John 9:25</aside><p>I try to explain to you the joy of following Christ: the thrill, the excitement, the exhilaration—knowing where I&#8217;ve come from, why I&#8217;m here, where I&#8217;m going! There&#8217;s a reason for existence. There&#8217;s a reason for getting up every morning of the year. I try to tell you what I&#8217;ve found in Jesus Christ, and in studying the Scriptures and walking with Him, and you say, &#8220;I can&#8217;t see that!&#8221; Of course, you can&#8217;t. You are blind. Try to explain television to a blind man. He can understand a little of it, but it doesn&#8217;t make sense to him. Try to explain a sunset to him. He&#8217;s blind to it. The scales must be removed from your eyes, and only Christ can do that. He can remove them right now and you can start living and seeing a whole new world that you never knew existed, if you will let Him open your spiritual eyes.</p>
