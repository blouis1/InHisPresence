<h1>The Light of the World</h1>

<aside>The Lord is my light and my salvation . . . <br />&mdash;Psalm 27:1</aside><p>Under the picture of Peter Milne, hanging in the church he founded on the little New Hebrides Island of Nguna, these words are found: &#8220;When he came, there was no light. When he died, there was no darkness.&#8221; When Christ came into the world, there was no light. Matthew (quoting Isaiah) said of Him, &#8220;The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up&#8221; (Matthew 4:16). Harry Lauder once said that during his boyhood, he could tell where the lamplighter was &#8220;by the trail of light he left behind him.&#8221; Christ was the heavenly Lamplighter. Everywhere He went, the midnight gloom of sin and despair disappeared before Him.</p>
