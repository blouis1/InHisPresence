<h1>He is Coming Back</h1>

<aside>Keep a sharp lookout! For you do not know when I will come. . . Watch for my return!<br />&mdash;Mark 13:35, 36 (TLB)</aside><p>The great Dwight L. Moody used to say, &#8220;I never preached a sermon without thinking that possibly the Lord may come before I preach another.&#8221; Dr. G. Campbell Morgan, the distinguished British clergy-man, said, &#8220;I never begin my work in the morning without thinking that perhaps he may interrupt my work and begin His own. I am not looking for death. I am looking for Him.&#8221; That is the way a Christian should live his life &#8211; in the constant anticipation of the <a href="../../../articlepage.asp?articleid=1046" target="_blank">return of Jesus Christ</a>! If we could live every day as though it may be the very last one before the final judgment, what a difference it would make here on earth! But we don&#8217;t like to think that way. We don&#8217;t like to think that our carefully made plans, our long range schemes may be interrupted by the trumpet of God. Too many people would rather say, &#8220;Oh, well, the end of the world hasn&#8217;t come yet, so why think about it &#8211; it&#8217;s probably a thousand years away.&#8221;</p>
