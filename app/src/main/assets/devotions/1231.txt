<h1>God Loves You!</h1>

<aside>We know how much God loves us because <BR>we have felt his love . . . <br />&mdash;1 John 4:16 (TLB)</aside><p>Never question God&#8217;s great love, for it is as unchangeable a part of God as is His holiness. Were it not for the love of God, none of us would ever have a chance in the future life. But God is love! And His love for us is everlasting.</p>
<p>The promises of God&#8217;s love and forgiveness are as real, as sure, as positive, as human words can make them. But, like describing the ocean, its total beauty cannot be understood until it is actually seen. It is the same with God&#8217;s love. Until you actually possess true peace with God, no one can describe its wonders to you.</p>
