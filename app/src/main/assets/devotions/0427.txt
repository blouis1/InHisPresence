<h1>God, Our Helper</h1>

<aside>I am like a sheltered olive tree protected by the Lord himself. I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever.<br />&mdash;Psalm 52:8 (TLB)</aside><p>Turn to your Bible and read the wonderful stories of men who were alone in godless surroundings but who, by the help and presence of the living God, made a marvelous contribution to their own times. Joseph was surrounded by sin and intrigue in Egypt. His master&#8217;s wife tried to seduce him. He was tested by imprisonment, but through it all he trusted in God and sought to know and do His will; and he stands today as a wonderful example of the keeping and strengthening power of God in the heart of a man who believed in Him.</p>
