<h1>The Beginning of Wisdom</h1>

<aside>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom . . . <br />&mdash;1 Corinthians 1:30</aside><p>I believe we ought to get all the education we can, but we dare not make it our god. John Dewey once defined education as the systematic, purposeful reconstruction of experience; but so much of modern education leaves out God. What we are actually doing is reconstructing our sins. We expand our sins, enlarge them, multiply them. We need education, but not just for the mind and the body; we also need education for the spirit. Man has a spirit, and in our educational system today we need a spiritual emphasis. If we bring up a generation that lacks the wisdom that God can give, they can turn into educated savages and fools. &#8220;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom&#8221; and education. Let&#8217;s make sure our rock is God.</p>
