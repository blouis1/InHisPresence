<h1>God’s Love is Obvious</h1>

<aside>. . . the love of God toward us . . . <br />&mdash;1 John 4:9</aside><p>Notice God&#8217;s love. The Bible teaches that God is love. You and I were sinners. We were aliens from God. We were enemies of God. We had rebelled against God. We deserved hell, but in spite of the fact that we resisted God, we rebelled against God, we sinned against God, we were enemies of God-the Bible says God loved us anyway with an everlasting love so that He was willing to give His Son to die on the cross for our sins. There is not a person who has the ability to love that way unless he comes to Christ. You don&#8217;t have the power to love.</p>
