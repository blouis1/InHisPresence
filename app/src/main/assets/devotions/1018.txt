<h1>Blessed Are Peacemakers</h1>

<aside>I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety.<br />&mdash;Psalm 4:8</aside><p>In a materialistic world which has tried to sever diplomatic relations with God, we have nowhere to retreat except within ourselves. We are like turtles in a traffic jam—the best we can do is to pull our heads into our shells and shut our eyes. But that&#8217;s a good way to get the life crushed out of us, as any dead turtle can attest.</p>
<p>Man&#8217;s conflict with man has been but an expression on the human level of his conflict with God. Until man finds an armistice with God, he cannot know peace with his fellowman. If we are to be peacemakers, we first must make our peace with God.</p>
