<h1>Triumph in Affliction</h1>

<aside>You don't understand now why I am doing it; some day you will.<br />&mdash;John 13:7 (TLB)</aside><p>May I remind you that physical illness is not the worst thing that can happen to you? Some of the most twisted, miserable people I have ever met had no physical handicap. Some of the world&#8217;s greatest and most useful people have been handicapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Messiah&#8221; was composed by Handel, who was suffering from a paralyzed right side and arm. Catherine Booth, in the last year of her life, said that she could not remember one day free from pain.</p>
<p>Helen Keller has written, &#8220;I thank God for my handicaps, for through them I have found myself, my work, and God.&#8221; Some of the most radiant Christians I have ever met were &#8220;wheelchair&#8221; saints. May God give you grace to &#8220;triumph in affliction.&#8221;</p>
