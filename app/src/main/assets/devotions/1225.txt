<h1>What does Merry Mean?</h1>

<aside>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God . . . <br />&mdash;Luke 2:13</aside><p>When at this season of the year we wish our friends a &#8220;Merry Christmas,&#8221; it is essential to realize that true merriment of heart is contingent upon the recognition of the truth that Christ was born in Bethlehem for our salvation. The word &#8220;merry&#8221; is from an old Anglo-Saxon word which sometimes meant &#8220;famous,&#8221; &#8220;illustrious,&#8221; &#8220;great,&#8221; or &#8220;mighty.&#8221; Originally, to be merry did not imply to be merely mirthful, but strong and gallant. It was in this sense that gallant soldiers were called &#8220;merry men.&#8221; Favorable weather was called &#8220;merry weather.&#8221; Brisk winds were called a &#8220;merry gale.&#8221; Spenser speaks of London as &#8220;merry London.&#8221; The word &#8220;merry&#8221; carries with it the double thought of &#8220;might&#8221; and &#8220;mirth,&#8221; and is used both ways in Scripture. One of the early Christmas carols was &#8220;God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen.&#8221; The Christian is to engage in spiritual merriment as he thinks upon the fact that, through the redemption, he becomes a child of God&#8217;s family. The Bible teaches that the angels made merry at Christ&#8217;s birth.</p>
