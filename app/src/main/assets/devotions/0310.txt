<h1>Not Good Enough</h1>

<aside>. . . not having mine own righteousness . . .<br />&mdash;Philippians 3:9</aside><p>People go through many doors which do not lead to the Kingdom of God. Some try the door of good works. They say, &#8220;I can get to heaven if I only do enough good things, because God will honor all the good things I do.&#8221; It&#8217;s wonderful to do good things, but we cannot do enough good things to satisfy God. God demands perfection, and we&#8217;re not perfect. If we&#8217;re going to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, we have to be absolutely perfect. You ask, &#8220;Well, how will I ever be perfect?&#8221; We need to be clothed in the righteousness of the Lord Jesus. There is one door to the Kingdom and it&#8217;s Jesus. And we will never get to heaven unless we go His way.</p>
