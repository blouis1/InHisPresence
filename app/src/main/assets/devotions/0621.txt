<h1>Tears of Repentance</h1>

<aside>Now change your mind and attitude to God and turn to him so he can cleanse away your sins and send you wonderful times of refreshment from the presence of the Lord.<br />&mdash;Acts 3:19 (TLB)</aside><p>There is a certain amount of sorrow involved in repentance that we don&#8217;t see much of today. That word means moaning and even groaning. I don&#8217;t mean that we have to have a great emotional experience, but I do believe that we need some tears of repentance. We need to be sorry for our sins, and to say, &#8220;Oh, God, I have sinned against You, and I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221; I am not an emotional person. I don&#8217;t know why, but I don&#8217;t cry easily. But of the few times I have cried in my life, some of them have been over sin that I committed many years ago.</p>
<p>The night I came to Christ, I didn&#8217;t have any tears. But later I went home and I looked out my window at the North Carolina sky and I cried over my sins. I said, &#8220;Oh, God, forgive me.&#8221; And the most wonderful peace swept over my soul. From that moment on, I&#8217;ve known that my sins were forgiven.</p>
