<h1>Love Despite Ourselves</h1>

<aside>. . . all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags . . . <br />&mdash;Isaiah 64:6</aside><p>The Bible teaches that all our righteousness-falling short of the divine standard as it does-is as filthy rags in the sight of God. There is absolutely no possibility of our manufacturing a righteousness, holiness, or goodness that will satisfy God. Even the best of us is impure to God. I remember one day when my wife was doing the washing. The clothes looked white and clean in the house, but when she hung them on the line they appeared soiled and dirty, in contrast to the fresh-fallen snow.</p>
<p>Our own lives may seem at times to be morally good and decent; but in comparison to the holiness and the purity of God, we are defiled and filthy. In spite of our sins and moral uncleanness God loves us. He decided to provide a righteousness for us. That is the reason that He gave His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross.</p>
