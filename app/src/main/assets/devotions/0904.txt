<h1>Christ’s Greatest Work</h1>

<aside>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against<BR>principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.<br />&mdash;Ephesians 6:12</aside><p>Jesus worked all His life. But the greatest work that Jesus did was not in the carpenter&#8217;s shop, nor even at the marriage feast of Cana where He turned the water into wine. The greatest work that Jesus did was not when He made the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, nor even the dead to rise. The greatest work that Jesus did was not when He taught as One having authority, or when He scathingly denounced the Pharisees for their hypocrisy. The greatest work that Jesus did was not in the great ethical program He presented to mankind—that program which has become the foundation for Western culture. What, then, was His greatest work? His greatest work was achieved in those three dark hours on Calvary. Christ&#8217;s greatest work was His dying for us.</p>
