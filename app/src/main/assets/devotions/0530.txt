<h1>Salvation is Free</h1>

<aside>Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.<br />&mdash;Romans 3:24</aside><p>Salvation is free! God puts no price tag on the Gift of gifts—it&#8217;s free! Preachers are not salesmen, for they have nothing to sell. They are bearers of Good News—the good tidings that &#8220;Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures&#8221; (1 Corinthians 15:3). Money can&#8217;t buy it. Man&#8217;s righteousness can&#8217;t earn it. Social prestige can&#8217;t help you acquire it. Morality can&#8217;t purchase it. It is, as Isaiah said, &#8220;without money and without price.&#8221;</p>
<p>God is not a bargaining God. You cannot barter with Him. You must do business with Him on His own terms. He holds in His omnipotent hand the priceless, precious, eternal gift of salvation, and He bids you to take it without money and without price. The best things in life are free, are they not? The air we breathe is not sold by the cubic foot. The water which flows crystal clear from the mountain stream is free for the taking. Love is free, faith is free, hope is free.</p>
