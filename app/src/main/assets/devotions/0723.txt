<h1>Sufficient to Meet Your Needs</h1>

<aside>I am with you, that is all you need. My power shows up best in weak people.<br />&mdash;2 Corinthians 12:9 (TLB)</aside><p>A director of a camp whose purpose is to lead young hoodlums to Christ says, &#8220;Being a Christian is the toughest thing in the world. What&#8217;s tougher than loving your enemy?&#8221; One boy, who developed into a rugged disciple of Christ at this camp, said, &#8220;In this outfit we&#8217;re all brothers and we&#8217;re all men. It was too tough for me at first, but then I heard that through Christ everything is possible. Then the roughness went away. I say a man is not a man, not a full man, until he gets to know Jesus Christ.&#8221; Yes, the Christian life is tough and rough; but it&#8217;s challenging. It&#8217;s worth everything it costs to be a follower of Jesus Christ. You will soon find that the cross is not greater than His grace. When you pick up the cross of unpopularity, wherever you may be, you will find God&#8217;s grace is there, more than sufficient to meet your every need.</p>
