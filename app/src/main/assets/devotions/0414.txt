<h1>The Return of the Lord</h1>

<aside>Our homeland is in heaven, where our Savior the Lord Jesus Christ is; and we are looking forward to his return . . . <br />&mdash;Philippians 3:20 (TLB)</aside><p>The Scriptures indicate that we are living in man&#8217;s day. But there is coming a day that will be called the Day of the Lord. In the midst of hopelessness, there is hope! And that hope is centered in the God-man, the Lord Jesus Christ. Now the will of man runs riot in the earth. Then the will of the Lord will alone be done. Until that time, we are under orders from the King of kings to proclaim His message. When we engage in evangelism, we are obeying His great command to &#8220;go and proclaim.&#8221; In doing so, we are hastening the day of His return.</p>
