<h1>The Need For Love</h1>

<aside>Keep yourselves in the love of God . . . <br />&mdash;Jude 21</aside><p>A husband and wife visited an orphanage where they hoped to adopt a child. In an interview with the boy they wanted, they told him in glowing terms about the many things they could give him. To their amazement the little fellow said, &#8220;If you have nothing to offer except a good home, clothes, toys, and the other things that most kids have-why, I would just as soon stay here.&#8221; &#8220;What on earth could you want besides those things?&#8221; the woman asked. &#8220;I just want someone to love me,&#8221; replied the little boy. There you have it! Even a little boy knows that &#8220;man shall not live by bread alone.&#8221; Our deeper yearnings and longings can be met only by a renewed fellowship with the One in whose image we were created, God.</p>
