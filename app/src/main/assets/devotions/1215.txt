<h1>Not Too Young</h1>

<aside>Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers . . . <br />&mdash;1 Timothy 4:12</aside><p>Lord Chesterton once said, &#8220;I believe in bedside repentance, but I do not want to depend upon it.&#8221; During a serious illness a person&#8217;s mind does not function normally. Getting right with God is something one should do in the bloom of health. However, as far as the Lord is concerned, &#8220;His ear is not heavy that He cannot hear, nor His arm shortened that He cannot save.&#8221; He loves us equally, in sickness or in health; while we are living, or while we are dying. In my experience, I have not known of too many people who found Christ on their deathbed. When we come to Christ in our youth, a life is saved. When we come in old age, a soul is salvaged and life eternal is assured; but the opportunity to live a life for Christ has been lost.</p>
