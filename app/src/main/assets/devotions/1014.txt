<h1>Pure in Heart</h1>

<aside>He that walketh righteously . . . shall dwell on high.<br />&mdash;Isaiah 33:15,16</aside><p>Being pure in conduct also includes honesty and integrity in dealing with our fellowmen. A Christian should be known in his neighborhood or place of business as an honest person, a person who can be trusted. Jesus said, &#8220;Blessed are the pure in heart.&#8221; Do you want to be happy? All right, apply this Beatitude to your heart. Take it to yourself.</p>
<p>The pure in heart are the only ones who can know what it means to be supremely happy. Their hearts are pure toward God and, as a result are pure toward their fellowmen. They are happy because, in possessing Him who is All and in All, they envy no man&#8217;s worldly goods. They are happy because they envy not another man&#8217;s praise. Because they are the enemy of no man, they regard no man as their enemy. The result is peace with God and the world.</p>
