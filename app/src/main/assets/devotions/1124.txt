<h1>Word and Deed</h1>

<aside>O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever.<br />&mdash;Psalm 118:1</aside><p>This year as we observe our season of thanksgiving, let us be grateful not only in word but also in deed. Let our gratitude find expression in a resolve to live a life more unselfish and more consecrated to Jesus Christ. When we sit around our tables laden with sumptuous delicacies, let us not forget that half the world will go to bed hungry. As we enjoy the comforts of our cozy homes, let us not forget that great numbers in other parts of the world have no homes to go to.</p>
<p>When we step into our sleek automobiles, let us not forget that most of the people in the world cannot afford even a bicycle. In the Lord&#8217;s Prayer as recorded in the sixth chapter of Matthew, we read, &#8220;Give us this day our daily bread.&#8221; Scripture teaches that the good things of this life are the gifts of God, and that He is the donor of all our blessings. Thanksgiving? Yes. Let us get on our knees humbly and thank God for the blessings He has given us, both material and spiritual. They have come from His hands.</p>
