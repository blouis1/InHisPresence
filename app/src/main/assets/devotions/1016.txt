<h1>Loneliness</h1>

<aside>My heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.<br />&mdash;Psalm 84:2</aside><p>Loneliness is one of the greatest problems people face today. It is a leading cause of suicide-that is now the third greatest killer of students in the United States. People feel various kinds of loneliness. One of the most common is the loneliness of solitude. Or there is the loneliness of suffering. Many people experience loneliness in society, or there is the loneliness of sorrow, guilt, and judgment.</p>
<p>All of us feel at times a loneliness for God. Someone has called it cosmic loneliness. We don&#8217;t know what it is. It makes us restless. You see, man was made for God; and without God, he is lonely. But Jesus is knocking at the door of our heart, saying, &#8220;I want to come in. Let me in.&#8221; He doesn&#8217;t push His way through that door. We have to open it and invite Him in; when we do, He comes in to live forever and we are never lonely again.</p>
