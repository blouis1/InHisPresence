<h1>Need For Inner Change</h1>

<aside>Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.<br />&mdash;2 Corinthians 5:17</aside><p>The world says that all we need to do is be decent, respectable, and reasonable. True, that is all one needs to do to be a member of the Great Society, but to be a member of the Kingdom of God, there must be an inner change. A Communist in Hyde Park, London, pointed to a tramp and said, &#8220;Communism will put a new suit on that man.&#8221; A Christian standing nearby said, &#8220;Yes, but Christ will put a new man in that suit!&#8221;</p>
