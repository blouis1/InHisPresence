<h1>Change Yourself, Change the World</h1>

<aside>Every one of us shall give account of himself to God.<br />&mdash;Romans 14:12</aside><p>I do not quarrel with Karl Marx&#8217;s statement that &#8220;religion is the opiate of the people.&#8221; I never try to defend religion. Religion has spawned wars. Many so-called religious people have been characterized by prejudice, pride, bickering, and even tolerance for slavery. However, I would call you to a simple faith in Jesus, who said, &#8220;Love your neighbor as yourself.&#8221; Are you really concerned? Are you disappointed with society? If you are, I challenge you to take the first step. I challenge you to look at yourself.</p>
