<h1>What is Most Important?</h1>

<aside>For if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ must still be dead. And if he is still dead, then all our preaching is useless and your trust in God is empty, worthless, hopeless. . . . The fact is that Christ did actually rise from the dead . . . <br />&mdash;1 Corinthians 15:13,14,20 (TLB)</aside><p>I was invited to have coffee one morning with Konrad Adenauer before he retired as the Chancellor of Germany. When I walked in, I expected to meet a tall, stiff, formal man who might even be embarrassed if I brought up the subject of religion. After the greeting, the Chancellor suddenly turned to me and said, &#8220;Mr. Graham, what is the most important thing in the world?&#8221; Before I could answer, he had answered his own question. He said, &#8220;The resurrection of Jesus Christ. If Jesus Christ is alive, then there is hope for the world. If Jesus Christ is in the grave, then I don&#8217;t see the slightest glimmer of hope on the horizon.&#8221; Then he amazed me by saying that he believed that the resurrection of Christ was one of the best-attested facts of history. He said, &#8220;When I leave office, I intend to spend the rest of my life gathering scientific proof of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.&#8221; It was the fact of the resurrection of Christ that called the disciples to go out as burning young revolutionaries to change the world of their day. They preached that Christ is alive. This should be our message every day of the year.</p>
