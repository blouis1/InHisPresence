<h1>Unspeakable Joy</h1>

<aside>And the disciples were called Christians . . . <br />&mdash;Acts 11:26</aside><p>In the third century Cyprian, the Bishop of Carthage, wrote to his friend Donatus, &#8220;It is a bad world, Donatus, an incredibly bad world. But I have discovered in the midst of it a quiet and holy people, who have learned a great secret. They have found a joy which is a thousand times better than any of the pleasures of our sinful life. They are despised and persecuted, but they care not. They are masters of their souls. They have overcome the world. These people, Donatus, are Christians . . . and I am one of them.&#8221; If you have repented of your sins and have received Christ as Savior, then you, too, are one of them.</p>
