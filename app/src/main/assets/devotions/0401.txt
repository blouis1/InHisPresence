<h1>Glory in the Cross</h1>

<aside>As for me, God forbid that I should boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br />&mdash;Galatians 6:14 (TLB)</aside><p>What glory is there in the cross? It was an instrument of torture and shame. Why did Paul glory in it? He gloried in it because the most selfless act ever performed by men or angels took place upon it. He saw-emanating from that rough, unartistic beam upon which the Son of God had been crucified-the radiant hope of the world, the end of the believer&#8217;s bondage to sin, and the love of God shed abroad in the hearts of men. A lone man dying on a cross did more to restore man&#8217;s lost harmony with God, his fellowman, and himself, than the combined genius and power of earth&#8217;s mighty. With my finite limitations, I cannot fully comprehend the mystery of Christ&#8217;s atonement. I only know that all who come to the cross in simple, trusting faith lose all their guilty stains and find peace with God.</p>
