<h1>The Hope of Resurrection</h1>

<aside>He which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus . . . <br />&mdash;2 Corinthians 4:14</aside><p>The resurrection of Christ brings hope. The late Emil Brunner once said, &#8220;What oxygen is for the lungs, such is hope for the meaning of human life.&#8221; As the human organism is dependent on a supply of oxygen, so humanity is dependent on its supply of hope. Yet today hopelessness and despair are everywhere. Peter, who himself was given to despair during the episode of Calvary, writes in a triumphant note, &#8220;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant mercy hath begotten us again into a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is hope that mistakes and sins can be forgiven. There is hope that we can have joy, peace, assurance, and security in the midst of the despair of this age. There is hope that Christ is coming soon—this is what is called in Scripture &#8220;the blessed hope.&#8221; There is hope that there will come some day a new heaven and a new earth, and that the Kingdom of God will reign and triumph. Our hope is not in our own ability, or in our goodness, or in our physical strength. Our hope is instilled in us by the resurrection of Christ.</p>
